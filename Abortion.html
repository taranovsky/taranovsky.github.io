<h2 align="center">Abortion</h2>
<p>One of the most important philosophical issues ever concerns the
definition of a person and who is able to feel. Abortion, which is a
deliberate termination of pregnancy, is one of the most important
practical applications of that issue. Life on Earth is threatened with
destruction from overpopulation and the poverty that overpopulation
causes. Fortunately, abortion decreases and can prevent overpopulation.
The question about whether abortion should be done is primarily the
question about whether the embryo or fetus is a person. In most cases,
the embryo weighs less than 100grams: less than 10% of human brain.
Abortion should be legal since it is useful and since humans become
conscious after birth, not before.</p>
<h3>Values for Human Society</h3>
<p>People are protected by ethics and by law since they are able to
feel. Many actions are considered immoral because they cause innocent
people to feel pain. If an object cannot feel, then it will not feel
pain if damaged, and the treatment of the object is chosen to benefit
those who feel.<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc">[1]</a></p>
<p>In general, actions are considered best when they cause the greatest
happiness to the society, the collection of all conscious<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a>objects. (In this paper, objects are used as a
generic term for anyone or anything.) To prevent unbearable pain and
cruelty, and to prevent abuses that can destroy the entire society,
every conscious object has the fundamental rights of "life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness." (Jefferson) Any distinction among
objects that feel should only be based on what the objects do since no
reason exists to distinguish otherwise. Thus, a person is best defined
as a conscious object. </p>
<p>Of crucial importance is when abortion should be performed. If a
human embryo is conscious, its rights should be considered in abortion
decisions. If it is not, the decision should be based on the rights of
the mother and the benefit to the society. If an embryo that does not
feel is terminated, then the conscious object, a person, is never
created. Not creating a person is not immoral: When people are not
having sex, they are not creating a person. If the society has an
optimum population, the net benefit (benefit minus harm) of an extra
person will on average be zero.</p>
<h3>Practical Effects of Abortion</h3>
<p>The world has a problem of overpopulation, not under-population. The
environmental problems occur largely because too many people exist and
strain the natural resources.&nbsp; Thus, not creating an extra person
is on average good for the society. (If creating a person would on
average be good, then more people should be created, and the population
size is too small, not too large.) In abortion, when a mother chooses
not to create a person, the person is unwanted and thus probably should
not be created.</p>
<p>Much of the poverty found throughout the world is caused by having
too many children. Abortion prevents that and thus reduces poverty.
Poverty contributes to crime. Therefore, abortion reduces crime.
Unfortunately, the government in the USA does not support abortion for
poor people.</p>
<p>A serious defect in an embryo gives additional reasons for its
termination. For example, Down syndrome is a severe congenital disorder
that "is a major cause of mental retardation, worldwide." (Cozic 138)
Fortunately, fetal testing (with abortion) can prevent it. If the
couple with a defective embryo is determined to have a child, the
abortion and an extra pregnancy would be practically equivalent to
curing the defect at the cost of an extra pregnancy. Women are
sufficiently informed to know when the cost justifies the result. </p>
<p>Since the abortion is so beneficial, it should be legal and
frequently encouraged, provided that the embryo is not conscious.
Additionally, since any pregnancy disturbs a woman's body and people
should have control over their bodies, the woman should probably be
allowed to terminate the pregnancy.</p>
<h3>Philosophy on Who is a Person</h3>
<p>The problem remains to classify objects into those that feel and
those that do not. Feeling is meaningless without comprehending. All
evidence that an object is conscious is obtained by observing the
object's behavior and verifying that the object has a special ability to
think and comprehend.</p>
<p>A digression into some basic science may help to determine who or
what is conscious. Scientific models state physical laws. No physical
law states that any object can feel. Since feeling is a primary concept,
it cannot be explained in terms of physical laws: It must be
supernatural.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[3]</a></p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, each system is in a superposition of
orthonormal (mutually exclusive and normalized) basis states. Time
evolution of the system is deterministic. Observation requires that
quantum mechanics does not apply to the observer (an object that can
feel). Otherwise, the state of the observer would not be a randomly
selected basis state but a superposition of the basis states as required
by the principle of superposition. Quantum mechanics seems to apply to
all physical systems, confirming that observers are very special and
supernatural.</p>
<p>Therefore, an object must possess a set of strong and distinguished
characteristics to be an observer and thus be granted the fundamental
rights of people--otherwise, the object would be mundane and be a plain
physical object. The basic characteristics form the fundamental
difference between objects that feel and those that do not. The
characteristics must be observable because for an object to feel, the
feelings must be closely tied to the physical observable object. The
characteristics cannot be physical: A strong object is allowed by
physical theories. Moreover, physical distinctions (such as DNA
sequences, skin color, or chemical base of the object) are inherently
arbitrary and thus unreasonable. Therefore, the characteristics are
mental: a universal ability to learn, understand, and solve problems; an
understanding of being conscious; and the ability to have direct memory
of experiences. Other observable fundamental differences simply do not
exist.</p>
<p>If a conscious object has a direct and correct memory of an
experience, then during the experience, the object was able to feel and
should be judged conscious. If the object did not satisfy other
criteria during the experience, the consciousness is applied
retroactively from the time the object satisfied all of the criteria.</p>
<p>Since everything that can be understood can be explained logically,
an object that can think logically can understand everything<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[4]</a>. Logic is based on a very small
number of basic processes. Thus, if an object cannot understand
something, it cannot think logically and is unable to understand
something very simple. Understanding complex ideas is composed of
understanding many simple ideas. Since the number of basic simple ideas
is very small, almost every complex idea requires understanding of a
given basic idea. Thus, either the object has potential for universal
understanding or has a very limited to nonexistent understanding.
Universal understanding is one of the key distinctions between people
and animals closely related to people, such as chimpanzees. Clearly,
children do not obtain that ability until several years after birth.</p>
<p>One of the primary concepts is the ability to feel. The
understanding of the ability cannot be derived from other concepts since
it is primary. Instead, the understanding is one of the criteria for
determining whether the subject can feel. No evidence indicates that a
newborn (and thus unborn) child understands the concept.</p>
<p>The ability to form memories is clearly necessary for conscious
learning: Otherwise, the object cannot remember and thus cannot process
the information. Thus, the ability is required for universal
understanding and thought. Memories are also required for identity: If a
person does not remember anything before his or her birth, no evidence
exists that the person was still the same person before birth (or that
the person had existed before birth at all).</p>
<p>Can an object not satisfy these fundamental criteria and still be a
person? That point of view contradicts to the fundamental distinction
between objects that feel and those that do not. It also contradicts to
a basic statement that justifies human rights: "all men [conscious
objects] are created equal". (Jefferson) An object that does not satisfy
the fundamental criteria is fundamentally different (cannot be
fundamentally equal) from an object that does. Since all people are
fundamentally equal, the former object cannot be a person.</p>
<p>The ability to form memories is the easiest and most precise way to
determine whether an object is conscious for an object that is expected
to become conscious. Earliest memories of humans generally trace to
three years after birth. "We know we have no memory of self-awareness
before our first birthday, or even before our second." (Elroy) Thus, a
collection of human cells normally becomes conscious about three years
after birth. Since an unborn baby cannot yet feel, it should not have
rights and the woman should have unrestricted rights to terminate it.</p>
<h3>Infanticide vs. Abortion</h3>
<p>Should the mother be allowed to kill her child after birth? Although
the child does not yet feel, certain crucial differences exist between
abortion and infanticide. From both psychological and physiological
points of view, a born child is much closer to a person than an embryo.
A slight probability exists that a one year old child is conscious; the
possibility cannot be accepted when deciding whether to destroy the
child. Since its destruction is somewhat similar to destroying a
person, encouragement of the destruction can lead to encouragement of
violence. No clear distinction exists about the time the object becomes
conscious, making it dangerous to allow termination of the child until
it is believed to become conscious. Additionally, the woman's body is
altered by embryos, not children.</p>
<p>However, when abortion is unavailable, infanticide immediately after
birth might be a necessary method to prevent creating an unwanted
person. In Africa and in Latin America, safe abortion is unavailable but
overpopulation is a major problem. Infanticide should be used there as
population control. Moreover, since many severe defects become known at
birth, infanticide of abnormal babies immediately after birth is very
useful.</p>
<p>No strong reasons for infanticide exist several weeks after birth
since infanticide can be made in the first day. For the many reasons
mentioned above such infanticide should be prohibited. Thus, laws should
allow killing of the child by the mother only for the first week after
birth, and then only when abortion was not safely available or when the
child has abnormalities.</p>
<h3>Abortion vs. Non-terminal Damage</h3>
<p>Although abortion should be allowed, the pregnant women should not
have a right to bring serious nonfatal harm to their future children.
The harm does affect a conscious object (the future person) and is bad.
Thus, it is reasonable to require pregnant women to have an appropriate
lifestyle for development of a normal person. If a woman fails to have
an appropriate lifestyle, she may be penalized with forced abortion (to
prevent creation of defective people).</p>
<h3>Bible and Abortion</h3>
<p>Although some claim that the bible opposes abortion, the evidence
shows otherwise. The bible says, </p>
<blockquote>Then God said, "Let us make man [people] in our image, in
our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds
of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the
creatures that move along the ground." So God created man in his own
image, in the image of God he created him. (Genesis 1:26-27)</blockquote>
<p>"In his own image" cannot refer to a biological similarity; instead,
it refers to the special ability of people to think and understand
anything. This suggests definition of a person as an object that can
think and understand and is consistent with the definition given in this
paper.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God instructs: </p>
<blockquote>If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives
birth prematurely [has miscarriage] but there is no serious injury, the
offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the
court allows. But if there is serious injury [to the woman], you are to
take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot
for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. (Exodus
21:22-25)</blockquote>
<p>The death of a fetus is considered a destruction of property instead
of destruction of a person since the penalty is only a fine. Damage to
the woman, however, is a much worse crime since the punishment is much
more severe.</p>
<p>In Numbers 5:11-31, if a woman committed adultery, she is to have a
bitter drink that poisons her to punish her and bring miscarriage. Thus,
abortions are approved in case of adultery by the woman. In biblical
times, abortions were accomplished through poisoning the woman, clearly
a cruel procedure. "The typical abortion methods were to poison the
mother (hoping she lived while the fetus died) or to physically abuse
the mother's abdomen." (Gilbert) Thus, abortions were not recommended
for insubstantial reasons.</p>
<p>God (according to the bible) preordained some prophets before their
conception. The prophets were given a miraculous ability to communicate
with God. Some obtained soul even before conception. Jeremiah 1:5
states that God knew Jeremiah (a prophet) before conception. Those
prophets, of course, are not the majority population. Often, their
being human before birth is one of their distinctions from ordinary
fetuses who become people (that is conscious) after birth.</p>
<p>The New Testament places strict moral rules. Nowhere does it say
that abortion is wrong or that a fetus is a person. Its moral reaffirms
the position that people are people through their understanding and
thought.</p>
<h3>Additional Evidence on whether a Fetus is a Person</h3>
<p>In the early stages of pregnancy, overwhelming evidence shows that
the embryo is not conscious. A zygote is only a cell, it is clearly
unable to think. A zygote can sometimes evolve into more than one person
(identical twins). Since splitting of a soul in two is prohibited,
zygote cannot have a soul. Finally, "Up to 50% of fertilized eggs do
not implant. Of all implantations, only 10% are successful
pregnancies." (Cozic 115) If God considered embryos as people, he would
have prevented their death in such numbers.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that groups of people were granted rights is
that they demanded the rights. No fetus or newborn child has ever
claimed that it has insufficient rights or that abortion is immoral.
Fetuses fail the important test for humanity: people demand rights.</p>
<p>Appearance refers only to external characteristics. Since it does
not refer to mental abilities or the ability to feel, appearance should
not be used to determine what or who is a person. Fetuses may appear
like a person; however, they are not people. Size, however, can be used
to help understand object properties.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The article "Fetus" (Encarta) has the
following data: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<tbody>
    <tr><th>Time after conception</th>
		<td>4months</td>
		<td>6months</td>
		<td>7months</td>
		<td>Newborn</td>
	</tr>
    <tr><th>Mass of Fetus</th>
		<td>113g</td>
		<td>624g</td>
		<td>1.1kg</td>
		<td>3.4kg</td>
	</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The mass of human brain is about 1.5kg. Even after six months, a
fetus has a clearly insufficient size to be considered a person: It
weighs less than a half of human brain. Abortions are typically
performed when the fetus does not weigh much. "Fifty one percent of all
abortions in the United States occur before the eighth week of
pregnancy" (Cozic 114); over 91%-in the first trimester; "and more than
99% by 20weeks" (Cozic 114-115).&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main arguments against abortion is: "Fetus is a human.
All humans have a right to live. Therefore, fetus has a right to live."
The argument is due to a confusion about who or what is a human. From
biological point of view, "a human is a collection of cells that form an
organism and have identical genome corresponding to subspecies Homo
sapiens sapiens." From the perspective of human rights, "a human is a
conscious object"<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[5]</a>. A fetus is a
human according to the first definition but not the second. Since human
rights are based on the second definition, the fact that a fetus is a
collection of human cells does not mean that it should have rights.</p>
<h3>Effects of Prohibiting Abortion and Conclusion</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, abortion is prohibited in some countries. The laws do
not prevent abortion--many women have abortion anyway--instead, they
make abortion unsafe and illegal. "The total deaths due to illegal
abortion in Mexico alone is thought to be 140,000 out of 1.5million
abortions [per year]". (Emmens, 114) Legal abortion in USA is safe. On
average, only 0.0004% of abortions are fatal, only 0.5% of cases have
major complications, and the reported rate for minor complications is
10%. "By 1985 the risk of dying from a legal abortion had decreased
dramatically--to 0.4 deaths per 100,000 legal abortions." (Cozic 188) Of
course, abortion ends pregnancy, and pregnancy along with raising
children is a major complication on any woman's life.</p>
<p>Therefore, abortion does not involve killing of an entity that can
feel. The decision for abortion should be based on the effect on the
society. Abortion is very useful as birth control since it is 100%
effective and since it can administered several months after the sexual
intercourse. (However, abortion should supplement other birth control,
not replace it completely.) Women should have a right to abortion on
demand at all stages of pregnancy. The right will benefit us all. It
will enforce the fundamental concepts on who is trully a person, on the
equality of all people, on fundamental rights, and on the rights of
people to control their bodies.</p>
