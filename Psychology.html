 (Added on May 11,
2003)&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> Upon further observation and analysis, I found
that while the model presented here is general and very useful, it is
too incomplete.&nbsp; Complex learning, advanced cognition, the level of
personality specificity, and other phenomena are inadequately
explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that a more detailed yet both
general and correct model exists that covers the gaps of the model for
human psychology presented below.<br></font></p>
<h1 align="center">Psychology</h1>
<p>Psychology is the study of human thought and behavior. While
reasoning can lead to information about consequences of actions, to
determine whether an action should be done, a system of values is needed
since no logical rules state what should be done without using a value
as a premise. Thus, the thought consists of a way of reasoning and a
system of values. </p>
<p>A theory that is understood by a person cannot completely explain
human behavior since a person who knows the theory can purposely choose
an action that is not predicted by the theory. Thus, psychology cannot
possibly be complete. Every scientific theory is a model of an aspect of
the world. Models are used for prediction. Models are not the reality
and thus cannot directly disprove a religion. However, since no evidence
contradicts to the model below, the model has not only scientific but
philosophical significance.</p>
<p>People gather all of the information from their feelings (feelings,
broadly defined, include thoughts). <b>Pleasure</b> (also called
happiness) is defined as the aspect of feelings that makes people to
achieve more of it. <b>Pain</b> is negative amount of pleasure (and is
something that people avoid). Thus, the system of values is to achieve
maximum pleasure.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p> (Added on May 11, 2003) <b>Note:&nbsp; </b>A person can be
motivated only by his or her desires.&nbsp; Someone else's suffering is
not a motivation to help unless the person wants to help. &nbsp; In this
paper, pleasure is defined in a technical way to include all
desires.&nbsp; Selfishness refers to deficiency of the desires to help
other people.&nbsp; People whose desire to do good exceeds contrary
desires to benefit oneself&nbsp; should be praised to reinforce and
protect the desire.&nbsp; The desire to do good is partially intrinsic
(like the desire to eat), it can be self-reinforcing (it is good to
desire to do good), and it is consistently reinforced (good is what one
should do; people usually claim that they reward people for doing what
they should), so it persists against other desires.<br>
</p>
<p>Humans think (and learn) by forming <b>associations</b> (that is
connections) between objects. An object can be anything real or
imagined: a person, a physical object, a trait, an action, or even a
feeling. Although animals other than people probably do not feel, they
(especially higher animals) act as so they feel and their behavior is
often best modeled as a consequence of feelings. The associations are
formed in brain. The associations that cannot be readily retrieved at a
conscious command are called unconscious. Humans are distinguished from
other animals be their ability to form complex associations.</p>
<p>The types of associations formed depends on structure of the brain,
including the chemicals inside neurons. Much of the structure is
genetical. The genes are mostly determined by evolution--genetic
characteristics beneficial (to survival and reproduction of the
organism) in the past had multiplied. For example, humans have capacity
to learn language because the capacity assisted in communication and
thus survival and reproduction. The general model of associations to
achieve pleasure is made more complete by studying tendency to form
associations (<b>conditionability</b>) directly or through brain
structure or evolution. (Since animals differ, the general model without
some specifications can be ambiguous in predictions.) Conditionabilty
can, of course, be altered through associations.</p>
<p>Pleasure is determined by biological feelings (such as taste,
thirst, and physical pain) and psychological feelings (feelings that do
not have a clear external base). Biological feelings can generally be
effectively controlled only by changing the external cause.</p>
<p>Psychological feelings occur because of, often conscious, appraisal
(evaluation) of perception. The feelings include <b>curiosity</b> (when
information is unexpected), <b>love</b> (when an object that causes
pleasure is in contact with you), <b>achievement</b> (when you overcome
an obstacle), <b>anticipation</b> (when you expect pleasure), <b>motivation</b>
(when you want to do something), <b>empathy</b> (when you enjoy making
others feel good), and <b>humor</b> (when something is correct from one
perspective but clearly wrong from another perspective). These feelings
tend to cause pleasure. Psychological feelings can be controlled by
changing the appraisal. Much of anticipation is unconscious, causing
pleasure to be associated with some events or things. Love may be
unconscious anticipation due to an object (often a person).</p>
<p>Each of the feelings has a continuum of values and is best measured
as real number. All but humor have negative values: negative
anticipation is fear (when you expect pain), negative curiosity is
avoidance of new situations, love--hate, achievement--guilt (when you
did something wrong or did not overcome an obstacle),
motivation--inhibition, and empathy--revenge (pleasant feeling when
enemy is hurt). Feelings are usually composed of several of the basic
feelings described above. For example, anger consists of pain,
motivation, and revenge. Depression consists of pain, inhibition, and
close to zero curiosity.</p>
<p>Each natural event is caused by other events and/or chance. <b>Free
will</b> is the ability to choose an action. If all actions are caused
by previous events or chance, the organism does not have ability to
choose. Thus, free will cannot refer to natural events. Instead, free
will refers to supernatural aspects of human thought and behavior.
Therefore, free will cannot be explained scientifically.</p>
<p>Associations can be between two events (classical conditioning); or
among a situation, an action, and a consequence (operant conditioning).
When the observer is not involved in the events, the association is
called <b>observational learning</b>. Observational learning is weaker
than direct experience. Action is chosen based on associations between
the action in the situation and pleasure (or pain) of the consequences.
The associations are weakened by delay between action of the organism
and consequences. <b>Power of will</b> is the ability to sacrifice
pleasure temporarily for increase of pleasure later.</p>
<p>Below are several of the simple (and true) predictions of the model.
If mathematics is taught by showing algorithms for each problem,
students will find associations between problems and the solutions
given; students will be able to solve the types of problems they studied
but probably not other types of problems. Memories are retrieved when
things connected with the memories are thought thus creating an
association to retrieve the memory. Depressed people are more likely to
recall sad feelings because of connection between being sad and sad
feelings. A belief in rewards and punishments after death influences
people with large power of will the most; for most people immediate
reward is more important than an ambiguous reward promised to be given
after death. From experience, good things cost much; high cost is
associated with high quality, so high cost of clothes makes people think
of the clothes as more beautiful. When a person sees his friends use and
enjoy drugs (such as tobacco and alcohol), the person will associate the
drugs with pleasure and is more likely to use the drugs. Viewing
reinforcement of altruism creates an association between helping people
and pleasure thus causing enjoyment of giving assistance and increased
tendency to help. If most blacks encountered are stupid, a black is more
likely to be treated as stupid.</p>
