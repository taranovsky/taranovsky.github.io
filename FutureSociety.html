<h1 align="center" style="text-align: center;">Changes for the Future</h1>
<p>This document describes some aspects of how the society should work
and why.&nbsp; The emphasis is on simple changes from the current
society.</p>
<p><b>Food:&nbsp;<br>
Current Problem:</b>&nbsp; The food most Americans eat is bad for
health--it has insufficient nutrients and too many calories.&nbsp;
Restaurant food is expensive (and much of it is still bad for
health).&nbsp; Cooking food is time consuming (especially if the food is
to be tasty and with variety), requires special equipment (kitchen),
and special knowledge.<br>
<b>Solution:</b>&nbsp; Experts will develop combinations of foods that
are nutritionally complete, that is have all nutrients in the correct
amounts.&nbsp; Such combinations are mass produced to justify the
initial investment on their development and keep the costs low.&nbsp;
Since the number of acceptable combinations is very large, by selecting
appropriate combinations, healthy food would be cheap, tasty, and have a
large variety. &nbsp;Food sales tax will depend on how good the food is
for health.</p>
<p><b>Transportation:<br>
Current Problem:</b>&nbsp; Travel is required to go to work, to shop,
to meet people, and for entertainment.&nbsp; Travel often requires
cars.&nbsp; Cars are expensive to own and require special maintenance;
traffic congestion makes safe driving impossible.&nbsp; Public
transportation often does not meet the requirements.&nbsp; Taxis require
special ordering and waiting and are expensive because of the large
time investment on the part of the driver.<br>
<b>Solution:</b>&nbsp; A comprehensive public transportation system
will be developed.&nbsp; Such system will also solve road congestion,
reduce the waste of driving time, and greatly reduce air
pollution.&nbsp; Telecommunication will replace some of the need for
transportation.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Services:<br>
Current Problem:</b>&nbsp; Services are not cheap and are either very
expensive or of low quality.&nbsp; Product prices are inflated because
of the human services involved with the products.<br>
<b>Solution:</b>&nbsp; The problem is one of the most difficult and
important porblems for the twenty-first century. &nbsp;However,
improving basic education and access to knowledge, streamlining and
automation of services, and separation of products from services will
alleviate the problem.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge:<br>
Current Problem:</b>&nbsp; Although humans have discovered so much
knowledge, knowledge is often very difficult to find.&nbsp; Technical
knowledge requires a very long preparation.&nbsp; Internet has much
information but websites are often of low quality; webpages sometimes
disappear.<br>
<b>Solution:</b>&nbsp; A comprehensive and logical knowledge base will
be compiled. The knowledge base will allow quick searching and
acquisition of knowledge.&nbsp; Unneeded interdependencies of technical
knowledge will be greatly reduced.&nbsp; The government shall subside
private discovery of information and high quality informative websites.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archiving of internet preserves disappearing
websites (along with multimedia content). &nbsp;Books are preserved by
scanning and then distributing electronic copies.&nbsp; Digital copies
of audio and video are preserved (in a readable and not copy "protected"
format).&nbsp; Software, including games, is preserved through
archiving (with copy "protection" removed so that the software can be
used), preferably on the internet.&nbsp; Emulation is used to make
non-native software workable. &nbsp;(Lack of archiving would cause
irreparable loss of knowledge.)<br>
</p>
<p><b>Education:</b>&nbsp; <br>
<b>Current problem:</b>&nbsp; Education takes a very long time to
complete.&nbsp; Despite twelve years of schooling, most Americans lack
much of basic knowledge. &nbsp;Learning often requires unneeded detailed
knowledge, long meaningless practice sessions, and understanding poorly
written (low information density, and/or imprecise and with explanation
gaps) texts.<b><br>
Solution:</b>&nbsp; Textbooks should be logically and compactly written
to convey enough knowledge.&nbsp; The curriculum should be comprehensive
and cover all basic knowledge.&nbsp; Learning should consist of
learning of information, practice of knowledge, and development of
thinking skills. Learning should be done at individual pace.&nbsp; Most
practice must be individually customized because of the large
differences in relative learning abilities and preferences.&nbsp;
Special sessions are used to encourage logical thought and creativity.
Teachers should answer questions, guide practice of knowledge, provide
opportunities for further study for interested students, and assess the
students.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most education (starting with time that this
choice becomes feasible) should involve computer for easy selection of
information, powerful presentation of information, interactivity, and
relatively easy communication.&nbsp; High school diploma should reflect
achievement of basic knowledge plus reasonable achievement of
student-chosen additional knowledge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice should be used primarily for
internalization of knowledge and development of (subconscious) skills.
&nbsp;All significant knowledge should be easily available in the
ordinary form instead of just through practice.<br>
Learning from textbooks and from computers should be used to save costs.</p>
<p><b>Clothing:</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Current Problem:</b>&nbsp; People spend much money on clothing; yet,
the clothing is often inconvenient.&nbsp; Clothing has unneeded
qualities and messages.&nbsp; Convenient clothing may be difficult to
find.&nbsp; Some clothing is expensive.<br>
<b>Note:</b>&nbsp; The problem is relatively minor.<br>
<b>Solution:&nbsp; </b>Clothing is clearly separated into normal and
additional clothing.&nbsp; Normal clothing is clearly separated by
type.&nbsp; Normal clothing is designed to serve its physical
function-to shield skin, to protect from cold, to protect from pressure
of contact with a hard object, etc.&nbsp; Normal clothing should not
cause undue restraints on movement.&nbsp; When the purpose of clothing
is simply to cover skin, then the clothing should be thin, flexible, and
of a smooth texture not irritating to the skin.&nbsp; Shoes (including
sandals) should be designed for convenience of movement.&nbsp; Normal
clothing is carefully designed and then mass produced to keep prices
low.&nbsp; Additional clothing is used to serve fashions.<br>
</p>
<b>Independent Life:<br>
Problem:</b>&nbsp; Living independently requires a lot of specialized
knowledge and skills.&nbsp; While such skills are supposed to be gained
through childhood experience, many people lack the required skills.<br>
<b>Solution:</b>&nbsp; Required knowledge and skills should be easily
accessible--public education should include these skills, and the
knowledge should be described in easily accessible places.&nbsp;
Moreover, items required for independent life should be made easier to
use and, as appropriate, automated.&nbsp; (Difficult to use but
important items must be retained for those who know how to use them.)<br>
