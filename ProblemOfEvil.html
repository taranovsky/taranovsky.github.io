<H1 align=center> Human
Rights and the Problem of Evil</H1>
<P>Arguably, the
greatest challenge to faith in the omnipotent, omniscient, and fully
good being (&quot;God&quot;) is the problem of evil:  There is
so much evil in the world, so why does not God eliminate the evil?  A
number of solutions were proposed, with the main argument that life
can only be meaningful if people have to fight against problems and
have freedom to try different solutions, and that interference of God
would cause people to rely on God instead of fighting the problems
(evil) themselves.  Assuming that this argument is plausible, as I do
for this paper, another problem must be solved.</P>
<P>Justice and human
rights appear to be the basic principles of civilized society.  It is
considered wrong to murder regardless of the expected utility of the
murder.  It is also generally accepted that the society has a moral
duty to prosecute the murderer.  Torture and murder of a child are
clearly unjust and violate the child's rights, and so are generally
considered to be wrong regardless of the good they will cause.  Thus,
it appears that God should not allow torture of children to happen
even if the torture is necessary to enrich the life and bring
enlightened happiness to all people.  Since such torture happens
daily, it may appear that God does not exist. A na&iuml;ve solution
is to argue that God merely lets children to be beaten as they scream
in agony, instead of causing the beatings.  However, what causes a
choice in the mind to turn into action, and the physical state to
turn into suffering?  Physical laws appear to cause it, but physical
laws are merely mathematical equations which themselves cannot cause
anything, causation through laws requires a being to enforce the
laws, and that being is God.  Thus, God deliberately chose to enforce
physical laws that caused the torture.</P>
<P>If violations of
justice and human rights are inherently wrong, then the wrongness
would be in the violation itself instead of just in the violator. 
Violations by God are violations and as such would be inherently
wrong.  Since God is always good and such violations occur, they are
not inherently wrong (assuming that God exists).</P>
<P>If denial of
inalienable rights is not inherently wrong, then why is it wrong? 
Would it be right to drug and torture a captured soldier to extract
invaluable information?  The answer is that denial of basic rights by
people is wrong not because of the inherent wrongness but because of
the great dangers of such denials and because of the inherent
fallibility of humans.</P>
<P>Suppose that you
see a person who has captured a young child.  He tells you he is
&quot;creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making
men happy in the end, ... but that it was essential and inevitable to
torture to death one tiny creature&quot;  (from essay &quot;Rebellion&quot;
in <I>Reason and Responsibility</I>) the child that he is holding. 
He then asks you for advice on whether to kill the child.  How should
you answer?</P>
<P>The child should
live because her torture and death would be a real evil but the
promise of making men happy in the end is an illusion.  Even if he
believes or believes that he <I>knows</I> that the torture will
lead to human salvation he would still be unjustified because of
fallibility of beliefs.  In other words, the child should live
regardless of the expected utility of her death.</P>
<P>Fundamental rights
are those rights whose protection is essential for the society, so
denying fundamental rights by human actions is inherently improper. 
As illustrated below, fundamental rights are preserved not for their
own sake but because they are a necessary safeguard for the society. 
</P>
<P>A number of false
reasons exists for killing people.   Adolf Hitler believed that Jews
undermine and destroy the society.  Accordingly, to improve the
society, he oversaw killing of up to six million Jews.  Governments
without respect for human rights tend to kill off or at least silence
the opposition because the governmental objectives appear to be
necessary goods and the opposition, if prevailed, would thus prevent
the goods.  However, the governmental objectives in such cases tend
to be very harmful, and silencing the opposition prevents correction
of the objectives and locks the society into mistaken actions and the
suffering they will result into. What is the correct decision
heuristic on killing people?  To be correct, it must prevent the
unnecessary suffering mentioned above.  Suppose that the heuristic is
to kill a person if only if one knows that the act will bring greater
good.  If knowledge is restricted to states of human mind in which
the belief must be true simply because of the state of mind, then we
know almost nothing since beliefs of different people, even beliefs
that are held with certainty, often contradict.   Otherwise,
determination of knowledge can be based only on the belief of
knowledge, and in any practical implementation of the heuristic,
'knowledge' would be replaced with 'belief of knowledge'.  However, a
dictator who kills many useful people is likely to believe that he
knows what is good for the society.  For example, Adolf Hitler
believed that he knew that the final solution to the Jewish problem
is to exterminate Jews.  Thus, according to the heuristic, he was
justified in his actions.</P>
<P>Since the heuristic
above is unacceptable, the correct heuristic is not to murder people
even if one <I>knows</I> that the murders are good for the society.  
This way, human rights are justified on purely utilitarian grounds. 
For example, since people tend to be selfish, a democratic government
is essential to ensure that the government cares about the society. 
If the government has the power to censor, then the government
through censorship can prevent essential changes to the society and
can stop democracy by blocking ideas that oppose its policies. 
Moreover, heuristics on censorship would fail since the impact of an
idea cannot be known with certainty and since censors (who evaluate
the heuristic) are likely to be selfish.  Thus, freedom of speech
(absolute freedom from censorship) is a fundamental right.</P>
<P>Since God is
infallible, the argument for human rights does not apply to God, so
God is justified in enforcing physical laws that cause the child to
die as long as the enforcement brings greater good.  Thus, existence
of God is compatible with human rights, and human rights must be
protected regardless of whether God exists.</P>
<P>Some people believe
that human rights and justice must be protected in and out of
themselves.  The reason usually cited for such beliefs is the deep
feeling that human rights must be protected and that justice must be
administered.  Such feelings, however, must be fallible because
different people hold contradictory beliefs.  For example, most
people strongly feel that absence of sexual intercourse before
puberty is a fundamental protection for the children.  Other people
strongly feel that right of people, including children, to engage in
loving and consensual relationships and in intimate physical
interaction, such as sex, is fundamental.  At least one of these
groups of people should not trust their feelings.  One can trust
correct feelings and not trust wrong feelings, but that requires
determination of which feelings are correct.  To avoid the fallacy of
circular reasoning by trusting feelings to decide whether the
feelings are correct, such determination must be logical. 
Accordingly, every person should logically examine all beliefs that
are based on feelings.   (However, evidence for beliefs includes
evidence that the beliefs are useful.  For example, spiritual
satisfaction from belief in God makes the belief useful and can thus
be used as evidence to believe in God.)</P>
<P>Thus, the system of
values must be logically examined.  Ordinary logical principles only
perform a simple manipulation of statements and thus cannot derive
statements about values without relying on statements of human
values--the system of values is like a variable about which
statements can be made but whose value cannot be computed without
some assignment.  Thus, although ordinary logical principles can
obtain derived values from basic,  they cannot derive the basic
system of values.  The only other logical principle, being not
ordinary in the sense that it cannot be computed be a simple computer
program, is minimization of unexplainable:  Whenever ordinary logical
principles cannot resolve a question, whichever answer minimizes
unexplainable is assumed.  For example, ordinary logical principles
cannot prove that patterns that occurred the past tend to occur in
the future (see &quot;An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;
by David Hume for details).  Nevertheless, all people assume this
since it minimizes the unexplainable.  Similarly, minimization of
unexplainable is needed to prove that some beings other than you can
feel (or even exist).</P>
<P>A system that
assigns different values to different people would leave the
differential assignment unexplained.  Moreover, since the values are
basic, the differential assignment cannot be explained and thus must
be rejected.  An arbitrary discrepancy between what a person wants
and what the person should do is also unexplainable and to be
rejected.   A system that assigns different importance to happiness
at different times would leave the assignments unexplained.  Thus,
the system of values that achieves human desires and gives equal
importance to all people minimizes the unexplainable.  Since other
basic systems of values do not minimize the unexplainable, they must
be rejected.</P>
<P>Therefore, justice
is a derived value that is explained because denial of justice is
harmful to the society or at least has a potential to cause great
harm. The strong feeling of justice can be explained as evaluation of
evidence by the unconscious mind, which associates injustice with the
horror it often causes.  The feeling also causes fallacious
explanations of justice.  For example, justice is usually defined as
a state where people receive what they deserve.   Determination of
what people deserve is often defined as what is just, leading to
circular construction.  By an alternative circular reasoning, what
people deserve is determined by the good the people made since
anything else would be unjust.  Real justifications of rights and
justice, however,  are reduced to benefit to the society.  Feeling of
justice corresponds to evidence that 'justice' makes society
efficient and thus happier.  People deserve what maximizes happiness
and the meaning of life.   If justice is good, then justice is what
is good for the society.  Thus, God is justified in not using
miracles to stop alleged injustice assuming that the absence of
miracles brings a greater good.</P>
<P>Freedom is good
since freedom feels wonderful and makes the life meaningful.  Life
must be meaningful since without a meaningful life people cannot
appreciate life qualities and thus cannot be truly happy.  People
should try to achieve happiness since happiness is, by definition,
what people want.  However, true happiness should not be confused
with the superficial one.  For example, a person who wants to go on a
suicide mission appears to decline happiness, but in reality may have
great inner happiness from the service he gives to the society, and
might suffer guilt for the rest of his life (be unhappy) had he
declined the mission.</P>
<P>The apparent
conflict between human rights and actions of God is based on
misunderstanding about the justification of human rights.  Human
rights and justice are not important when taken in abstract and by
themselves.  However, fundamental rights must always be protected to
prevent grave dangers to the society.  Justice must be administered
to give incentives and thus to cause people to do good and avoid
evil.  God is justified in causing the world to evolve according to
physical laws if such action is necessary to make  human life
meaningful.</P>
