<p class="SectionTitle">Work Experience</p>

<p><b>eScription</b> <i>(division of Nuance)</i> (August 2006 – June 2011)<br/>
<i>Software Engineer</i><br/>
Worked on computer assisted medical transcription (speech recognition and text formatting). Created algorithms and developed software to effectively use very large data amounts, and achieved 15% accuracy improvement. Worked with a large computer farm, participated in research conferences (ICASSP, Nuance Research Conference), and maintained and cleaned up legacy codebases.  Used Python, Perl, shell, and C++ on Linux.<br/>
• Created a component to efficiently learn and apply millions of text mappings from billions of words of text.  Implemented various techniques for best selection and application of the mappings.<br/>
• Contributed to various formatting components for finding headings, formatting numerics, numbered list recognition, adding punctuation, applying rule-based text transformations, etc.<br/>
• Work involved full software lifecycle:  Design, programming, research/experiments, testing (including rollout and production monitoring, and addressing customer support tickets), and software maintenance and bug fixing.</p>


<p><b>Parametros Trading</b> (December 2012 – January 2015)<br/>
<i>Software Engineer</i><br/>
Analyzed performance of our high-frequency stock trading system, measuring patterns in very noisy data and running simulations, and made improvements to the trading algorithm.  Analysis of stock executions for a large hedge fund.  Engineering work to improve robustness and scalability.  Used Python, shell, and C++ on Linux.</p>


<p class="SectionTitle">Research</p>

<p><b>2015 – present (and earlier)</b><br/>
<i>Conducted independent research in set theory, mathematical logic, and computer science (see my <a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/MathematicalResearchStatement.html">research statement</a> for additional details):</i><br/> <!--(2004 – 2006,  June 2011 – November 2012, 2015 – present)-->
• Extended the language of set theory and provided semantics and axiomatization for higher order set theory; developed higher order set theory and demonstrated its close connections with large cardinal axioms (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0504375">old paper</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2270">new paper</a> and a <a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/ReflectiveSequences.html">further extension</a>).<br/>
• Created a strong ordinal notation system (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/OrdinalNotation.html">link</a>), and wrote a Python program for ordinal comparison and arithmetic using the system (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/OrdinalArithmetic.py">link</a>).<br/>
• Defined arguably finitistic properties of complexity up to the second order arithmetic (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/FinitismPaper.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Defined constructive truth for arithmetic and analysis, and developed a corresponding constructive theory (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605138">link</a>).<br/>
• Proposed a solution to the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-May/010554.html">link1</a> and <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-May/010555.html">link2</a>).<br/>
• Defined a finite analogue of infinite models (<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2005-November/009318.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Used probability to make conjectures in number theory about representability of numbers as sums of powers and primes (<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2005-October/009210.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Proved an equivalence between WKL<sub>0</sub> and a determinacy hypothesis (<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-February/010060.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Paper "Determinacy and Fast-growing Sequences of Turing Degrees" (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/SequencesOfTuringDegrees.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Paper "Arithmetic with Limited Exponentiation" (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/BoundedArithmetic.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Paper "Space-Efficient Circuit Evaluation" (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2217">link</a>).<br/>
• Paper "Elementarily self-embeddable models of ZFC"  (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/BTEE.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Paper "Asymptotic Optimal Sphericity" (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/Sphericity.html">link</a>).<br/>
• Proved that sorting is possible with lg(<i>n</i>!) + <i>o</i>(<i>n</i>) comparisons <a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/ComparisonSorting.html">(link)</a>.<br/>
• Paper "AI Notes" (<a href="https://taranovsky.github.io/AInotes.html">link</a>) (2023).</p>
