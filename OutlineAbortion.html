<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Outline of <I>Abortion</I></H3>
<P><B>Thesis:</B>&#160; Abortion should be legal since it is useful
and since humans become conscious after birth, not before.</P>
<P>I. People are protected since they can feel.</P>
<P>II. If a fetus does not feel, aborting it is equivalent to not
creating a person which is not immoral.</P>
<P>III. Abortion is very useful.<BR>A.&#160; Abortion prevents
creation of unwanted children.<BR>B.&#160; Abortion prevents creation
of abnormal children.</P>
<P>IV. Ability to feel is supernatural<BR>A.&#160; Physical laws do
not predict the ability to feel.<BR>B.&#160; Quantum mechanics places
special powers on observers.</P>
<P>V. Humans gain ability to feel at about three years after
birth.<BR>A.&#160; Feeling requires special abilities since it is
supernatural<BR>B.&#160; The special abilities are abilities to
think, understand, and form direct memories.<BR>C.&#160; Fetuses are
unable to reason.<BR>C.&#160; First memories trace to the age of
three years.<BR>D.&#160; Fetuses cannot be second-class people.<BR>E.&#160;
Abortion should be legal since it does not kill a soul.</P>
<P>VI. Infanticide has important differences with abortion.<BR>A.&#160;
Infants are much more similar to people than fetuses are.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;1.&#160; Killing infants may promote violence.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
2.&#160; Infants do not alter bodies of women like fetuses do.<BR>B.&#160;
Infanticide should only be allowed for the first week after birth and
only in limited cases.</P>
<P>VII. Bible supports abortion.<BR>A.&#160; Genesis states that
people are &#34;in the image of God&#34;, that is they have ability
to understand, solve problems, and remember.<BR>B.&#160; The
recommended penalty for causing miscarriage is a fine; the penalty
for killing a person is death.<BR>C.&#160; According to the Bible, in
case of adultery, women should sometimes be forced to miscarry.<BR>D.&#160;
According to the Bible, some prophets have a gift of being human
before birth.<BR>E.&#160; New Testament does not oppose abortion</P>
<P>VIII. Human embryonic development provides additional evidence for
abortion.<BR>A.&#160; Since zygote is just a cell, it cannot be a
person.<BR>B.&#160; Natural fetal death rate is high.<BR>C.&#160;
Fetuses do not ask for rights.<BR>D.&#160; Fetuses are too small for
people.</P>
<P>IX. If legal abortion is not available, most of the abortion would
occur anyway but would be illegal and unsafe.</P>
<P>X. Conclusion:&#160; Abortion is beneficial and should be allowed
on demand.</P>
