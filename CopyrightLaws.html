<h1 align="center">Economics of Copyright Laws</h1>
<p>Copyright laws are laws that restrict users of certain information,
such as literature works and computer programs, from distributing that
information. They are based on the belief that those who discover
information should have some control over who can use that information.
The control is mostly intended to allow the discoverers to make money
through distributing the knowledge only to those who pay them. However,
such control is inherently inefficient and infringes on the rights of
the users to obtain the information they need. Copyright laws should be
abolished because they are economically unsound. </p>
<p>If a person obtains information, his or her decision-making
capability is likely to improve, thus benefiting both the person and
other people. Using information does not hurt its original discoverers
since the only direct impact is on the user and the decisions made.
Thus, obtaining and using information is generally beneficial regardless
of whether it violates copyright laws.</p>
<p>By infringing on peoples' rights to obtain, use, and give
information, copyright laws prevent people from reaching correct
decisions (or at least slow down decision making) and thus are
inherently inefficient. For example, because copyright restrictions
require payment of high license fees, many businesses skip the upgrade
to Microsoft Office XP despite its important productivity enhancements.
A study showed that tasks requiring 43minutes with Office 2000 are
accomplished in mere 20minutes with Office XP--over 100% productivity
improvement (Microsoft Office XP vs. Office 2000 Comparison Test Public
Report). However, the proportion of businesses likely to upgrade from
Office 2000 during the first year of Office XP is 8%, second year--12%,
and after second year--15% (Smiley).</p>
<p>While works of art do not directly improve productivity, people
learn important ideas from art. The ideas may profoundly affect their
lives. Moreover, art can bring happiness, and the government should
strive to make the people happy. Therefore, all unnecessary laws that
reduce access to art by preventing people from communicating art should
be abolished.</p>
<p>Copyright laws are ineffective since they are frequently violated.
Worldwide, 40% of software is unauthorized (Business Software Alliance).
File-sharing networks make copyright laws unenforceable; almost all
popular songs can be obtained free of charge through these networks. The
victory in courts against Napster file-sharing service is empty since
in its place appeared file-sharing programs that do not require a
centralized server and thus are almost impossible to stop. In September
2001, 1.51 billion of (primarily copyrighted) files were downloaded
using distributed file-sharing networks. In October, that number rose to
1.81billion (Mariano). </p>
<p>The violations show a failure of copyright laws and cause special
problems. Because of copyright laws, money and resources are spent on
obtaining unauthorized copies of information, on enforcing the laws, and
on propaganda that using information to improve life without the
permission of copyright holders is theft and piracy. By abolishing
copyright laws, that money will be saved. Moreover, widespread
violations of the laws cause disorder and promote the dangerous belief
that violating laws is good. For example, the prohibition of alcohol in
the USA in the 1920s was unenforceable. Alcohol was delivered by
criminal groups, who often committed violent crimes, causing a dramatic
rise in organized crime.</p>
<p>Some claim that copyright laws are a necessary evil, necessary for
providing the incentive to discover information. However, financial
incentives are not central to the discovery of knowledge: People
discover information (by, for example, writing literature works) for
internal feelings of achievement, recognition, benevolence, and
understanding. For example, Van Gogh, one of the most famous painters of
all times, devoted his life to art and died in poverty (because his
talent was not recognized until after his death). He painted not for any
profit but because of the mental satisfaction from his art.</p>
<p>People are motivated to write open-source software not for financial
gain but to help the world and to have fun. Currently, despite lack of
government funding, open-source software (software that can be freely
reproduced and for which the source code is available) is of comparable
quality and often more powerful than "proprietary" software. For
example, one of the leading (and expensive) universities worldwide,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, uses mostly open-source software
for its computer systems. The development model of open-source
technology is inherently more efficient than proprietary software
(software that is developed in secret) because all people, not just the
secret group of developers can improve the software. Moreover, people
can customize open-source software to fit their needs, and all software
developers can use the code to write their programs.</p>
<p>Still, the discoverers should be rewarded to provide fairness and
additional incentives to discover. The rewards can come from charitable
individuals, organizations, and even large businesses. For example, in
year 2000, "IBM pledged $1 billion to help research and develop the free
Linux operating system, an alternative to Microsoft Windows" (Cha,
Ariana). IBM has adhered to the pledge and actually recouped its
investment through Linux powered IBM servers. In an another example,
each year, Nobel prizes are awarded to scientists because Alfred Nobel
donated his large fortune to fund the prizes. Moreover, even without
copyright laws, people will pay for advice such as tutoring, legal
services, software support, and psychotherapy: They cannot receive
individual advice by reading books, even if the books are free.
Copyright laws or alternatives are desirable not for individual
information but only for information that is good for many.</p>
<p>The rest of the compensation should come from governments.
Information is a public good--consumption by one person does not
interfere with consumption by other people--and public goods, such as
national defense, should be supported by the government. By replacing
copyright laws with government payments, the inefficiencies and failures
of the laws will be removed, but the incentives to discover knowledge
will be retained and refined.</p>
<p>To allow a smooth transition, the amount of payments should
initially be similar to the reward currently provided through copyright
laws. Eventually, the compensation will be chosen for the greatest net
benefit to the society under the constraint that all works considered
valuable by many or very valuable by some receive substantial
compensation. The constraint will allow full development of information
that the government does not fully approve.</p>
<p>The current compensation is the number of people willing to pay the
price times the price, where the price is varied by the copyright holder
to maximize revenue. The amount is only indirectly related to the
benefit of the information: Assuming the same willingness of people to
pay, the payments do not depend on the effect to the society. Creators
of virtual child pornography are rewarded by copyright laws to the same
extent as are writers of educational books. The government should
carefully correct the problem. While the pornography industry should
receive some compensation, the payment per unit of desire of people for
the information should be lower for pornography than for educational
works.</p>
<p>Copyright laws are economically harmful. They should be repealed, or
at least carefully restricted. The governments should quickly and
carefully decide and implement a proper compensation for those who
discover information. The world will become more free, and life will
become easier as people will obtain the knowledge they need.</p>

<h1 align="center">Copyright Laws and Human Rights</h1>
<p>Copyright laws are laws that restrict users of certain information,
such as literature works and computer programs, from distributing that
information. They are based on the belief that those who discover
information should have some control over who can use that information.
The control is mostly intended to allow the discoverers to make money
through distributing the knowledge only to those who pay them. However,
such control is economically inefficient (see "Economics of Copyright
Laws" by Dmytro Taranovsky) and infringes on the rights of the users to
obtain the information they need. Copyright laws prevent people from
distributing necessary information. They also prevent people from
writing books (called "derivative works") that are based on the ideas,
such as character personality, that have been "copyrighted". Copyright
laws should be abolished because they violate freedom of speech and of
the press. </p>
<p>Information is essential for making decisions and for intelligent
life. It can be present in different mediums such as oscillations of air
pressure (sounds), writings, paintings, videotapes, or pits and plateaus
(zeroes and ones) on a compact disk. People transmit information for
different purposes: They convey emotions, state facts, suggest actions,
give explanations, or make the receivers happy through works of art.</p>
<p>Information can be easily converted between mediums. For example, a
microphone with a computer can convert a song into a sequence of zeroes
and ones on a hard drive. Although it is in a different medium, the
information remains the same: A computer with speakers can convert it
back to the original form. A painting, can be scanned into a computer
and put as a sequence of zeroes and ones on a hard drive. The painting
remains the same because it contains the same information and creates
the same emotions when viewed by a person. All information can be stored
in a computer, where it is a sequence of zeroes and ones. Because the
medium (as opposed to content) of information is irrelevant, each
instance of information is equivalent to a sequence of zeroes and ones
(such as 101011).</p>
<p>Some claim that copyright laws protect "intellectual property".
However, can information be owned? Since a sequence of zeroes and ones
is an integer in the binary form (for example, 101011 is 1*2<sup>5</sup>+0*2<sup>4</sup>+1*2<sup>3</sup>+0*2<sup>2</sup>+1*2<sup>1</sup>+1*2<sup>0</sup>
= 43), and since all information is equivalent to such sequences, all
information can be presented as integers. Since integers cannot be
owned, and since "ownership of information" means ownership of all forms
of it, information cannot be owned. Thus, copyright laws do not protect
any property rights. As an integer, information is not created but
discovered: Every integer is a member of the set of all integers, and
"creation" of information is discovery that a particular integer has
special importance.</p>
<p>Free exchange of facts and ideas, called freedom of communication
(also called freedom of expression, originally called freedom of speech
and of the press), is one of the most basic human rights. It is granted
explicitly in First Amendment and implicitly in the Fifth, Ninth, and
Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. It is a
fundamental right since ideas, often ideas that appear dangerous, are
essential for imperative changes to the society. Additionally,
information is necessary for essential decisions and for the ability of
people to rule themselves through voting. Actions, not information,
cause damage. Governments cannot be correct when they decide what
information is needed for whom.</p>
<p>Copyright laws clearly restrict the press from publishing certain
works. Are these restrictions constitutional? Non-copyright restrictions
are generally considered censorship and are not approved. The courts
have uphold copyright laws because of the illusory belief that copyright
only outlaws a way of expression, which they claim is property of the
author, and not facts and ideas. According to a unanimous Supreme Court
decision, "The most fundamental axiom of copyright law is that [499
U.S. 340, 345] 'no author may copyright his ideas or the facts he
narrates'" (Feist v. Rural Tel. Service). Is there information that is
neither a fact nor an idea?</p>
<p>A zero or a one is a fact, and "yes" or "no" (equivalent to zero or
one) is an idea. A combination of facts is a fact. A composition of
ideas is an idea. Thus, each sequence of zeroes and ones is a fact per
se. Every sequence of zeroes and ones can be presented as an idea. </p>
<p>Therefore, every sequence of zeroes and ones is protected under
freedom of communication. For example, the locations of lands and pits
(which represent sequences of zeroes and ones) on a Microsoft Windows XP
compact disk is a fact, and it cannot be abolished (and cannot,
according to the quote above, be copyrighted). Since copyright laws
prevent free exchange of facts and ideas (by requiring consent of the
author before distribution), they are unconstitutional and violate
fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Of course, some actions are not protected under freedom of
communication. Dangerous or disturbing conduct may be prohibited even if
it expresses important ideas. People who make a claim can be made
responsible for the claim. Certain claims (such as the claim that the
advertised food is not poisonous) are made implicitly. Also, offensive
graphical presentation of information may require prior consent of the
recipient. However, each of these restrictions is not on facts but on
actions. Copyright laws outlaw integers, and integers cannot be
outlawed. Laws regulate actions and control objects and feelings, but an
integer is neither an action, nor a feeling, nor a physical object and
thus cannot exist in this world and cannot be subject to laws.
Punishing people  for "distributing" an "illegal" integer is arbitrary
and thus unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Some lawyers may say that outlawing facts is not inherently
unconstitutional but should be placed under strict scrutiny, that the
Congress has a compelling need for copyright laws, and thus the laws are
constitutional. However, while copyright laws may address a compelling
need, they are economically harmful and acceptable alternatives
(government compensation) exist. Thus, copyright laws do not withstand
strict scrutiny. Moreover, fundamental rights are granted regardless of
whether a compelling need exists to abridge the rights. The first
amendment simply prohibits abridgments of freedom of communication
without mentioning any compelling need.</p>
<p>They can also say that the Congress is authorized by the
Constitution (Article I Section 8 Clause 8) to make copyright laws.
However, since freedom of communication was added as an amendment (the
first amendment), it amends the power of the Congress to restrict
exchange of knowledge, and it overrides copyright laws at all points of
conflict.</p>
<p>Copyright laws are unconstitutional and harmful. They should be
found unconstitutional in the United States by courts and promptly
repealed elsewhere. The governments should quickly and carefully decide
and implement a proper compensation for those who discover information.
The world will become more free, and life will become easier as people
will obtain the knowledge they need, and as people will not be
prosecuted for helping others by giving valuable knowledge.</p>
