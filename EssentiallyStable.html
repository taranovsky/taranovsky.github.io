<h1 align=center>Radioactivity</h1>

<p>According to quantum mechanics, any reaction can occur if no conservation
law forbids it to occur.&nbsp; Therefore, any storage of free energy can by
itself lose free energy and decay.&nbsp; Half-life is the amount of time that
for a given single free energy storage, the probability that the storage will
decay is one half.&nbsp; Many energy storages (such as <sup>208</sup>Pb) have
an extremely long (such as 10<sup>150</sup>years) half-life. Such storages are
called essentially<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> stable.</p>

<p>Any nuclear reaction will occur if no conservation laws are broken and
energy is released<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>.&nbsp;
All isotopes with atomic mass larger than 89a.u. can decay so that energy is
released; therefore, they are radioactive.&nbsp; Moreover, there are no two
stable isotopes with the same atomic mass number since the heavier
<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
isotope can decay in the lighter one.</p>

<p>Because <sup>56</sup>Fe has the smallest energy per nucleon and because
conservation laws do not forbid conversion into <sup>56</sup>Fe, all substances
but <sup>56</sup>Fe store free energy and thus are essentially stable or
unstable.&nbsp; Many essentially stable substances (such as copper) consist of
stable atoms:&nbsp; Radioactivity is decay of an atom on its own; decay of
copper requires more than one atom for reactions such as&nbsp; 8 <sup>63</sup>Cu
&#8594; 9 <sup>56</sup>Fe.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>Conclusion/Summary:</b>&nbsp; A radioactive
atom is a storage of free energy.&nbsp; Moreover, all
atoms that are free energy storage can decay and thus are radioactive.&nbsp;
However, the half-life of many such isotopes is so large that they pose no
health or other hazard, and their radioactivity had not been detected
experimentally.&nbsp; Therefore, such isotopes are called essentially
stable.&nbsp; In essentially all applications, essentially stable isotopes can
be treated as stable.&nbsp; Scientists should define the exact border between
essentially stable and other radioactive isotopes.<br/><br/></p>

<h2 align=center>Radioactivity of <sup>209</sup>Bi</h2>

<p><sup>209</sup>Bi most likely decays by reaction</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><sup>209</sup>Bi&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;
<sup>205</sup>Tl&nbsp; +&nbsp; <sup>4</sup>He<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> </p>

<p>For this reaction, the amount of energy<a
name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
released, &#8710;E = &#8710;m*C<sup>2</sup>
= (208.98037 - 204.97440 - 4.00260) a.u.*C<sup>2</sup>
= 0.00337 a.u.*C<sup>2</sup> = 5.03*10<sup>-13</sup>J
= 3.14Mev</p>

<p>Because energy is released, the quantum theory predicts that <sup>209</sup>Bi
will decay (in this way, or, less likely, in another way).&nbsp; Therefore,
according to the definition of radioactivity, <sup>209</sup>Bi is radioactive.</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp; Since the &#945; particle (<sup>4</sup>He<sup>2+</sup>)
is ejected with a large (1.22*10<sup>7</sup>m/s) speed, it cannot pick up the
extra electrons from <sup>205</sup>Tl.</p>

<h3>Appendix A:&nbsp; Estimation of Half-life of <sup>209</sup>Bi</h3>

<p><i>Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles</i> by
Robert Eisberg and Robert Resnick
has, on page 225, a graph of dependence between E<sup>-0.5 </sup>[in MeV] 
and log R [in s<sup>-1</sup>]. The graph is
linear.&nbsp; (E is energy of the alpha particle; the energy is computed from
total release of energy and conservation of momentum; R is rate of decay.)</p>

<p>The following are two points on the graph: <br/>
(E<sup>-0.5</sup> = 0.4, log R = -2.693) and (E<sup>-0.5</sup> = 0.5, log R =
-16.923).<br/>
Therefore, slope of the line is -142.3 log s<sup>-1</sup>/MeV<sup>-0.5</sup>.</p>

<p>For <sup>209</sup>Bi, E<sup>-0.5</sup>=0.56424, so log R for <sup>209</sup>Bi=9.141
and R=8.63*10<sup>-27</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Thus, average life of atom, T = 1/R
= 1.16*10<sup>26</sup>s.&nbsp; Thus, the half-life of <sup>209</sup>Bi is &#8776;
 2.54 * 10<sup>18</sup>years.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Using this method, we can find half-life of other isotopes that undergo &#945; decay.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Note: The half-life of <sup>209</sup>Bi is only estimated.&nbsp; It is
possible that the half-life is really several times larger or smaller than
stated.</p>

<p>Legend: x axis is distance from the center of the nucleus, starting at zero<br/>
Black line (curved) shows potential energy of &#945; particle.<br/>
Blue line indicates total energy of alpha particle.</p>

<p>The sharp increase in potential energy is due to strong nuclear force.&nbsp;
The gradual decrease of potential energy is due to electromagnetic repulsion
between nucleus and &#945; particle.&nbsp; To leave the nucleus, 
the &#945; particle has to penetrate a region where its
total energy is less than potential energy.&nbsp; Using this model of &#945;
decay and quantum theory, the graph between E<sup>-0.5</sup> and log R was
obtained.<br/><br/></p>

This is a direct consequence of the first sentence of this paper.</p>

<p><a name="_ftn3" href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a>
There are no different isotopes (whose half-life is at least an hour) with
almost identical mass.</p>
