<h1 align="center">My Collected Works</h1>
<p><i>While I agree with most people on most issues, those issues are already covered by other people. The value of my papers, besides the technical insight, is for the issues on which most people are ignorant or wrong.</i>
<br/><b>Note:</b> The papers were written at different times, and they are not always updated as my understanding of the subject evolves.<br/><br/>

<h2 align="center">About Myself</h2>

<p>I was born on November 22, 1983 in Kiev, Ukraine.  In 1996, my family and I immigrated to the United States. My father (1954-2005) was a computer programmer with a passion for artificial intelligence. He died in accident while kayaking. I have a loving and supportive mother. From July 1996 through August 2001, I lived in the village of Columbia in the state of Maryland. While I was at high school, I studied advanced topics both independently and as a concurrent student in college. In June 2002, my parents and I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2005, I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In MIT, I majored in mathematics, and also studied computer science and physics. I am interested, however, in many fields of knowledge, such as philosophy and human rights. At MIT, I completed classes in mathematical analysis and abstract algebra, topology, algorithms, advanced classical mechanics, quantum and statistical physics, and many other topics. After MIT, I continued to live in Massachusetts engaged in independent mathematical research, specifically, in foundations of mathematics, mathematical logic, and set theory.  In August 2006, I obtained employment in eScription (now part of Nuance), and until June 2011, worked in speech recognition for medical transcription.</p>
