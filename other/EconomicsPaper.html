<h2 align="center" style="text-align:center">A Reform to Correct Inefficiency of
the Current Welfare System</h2>
<p>The United States of America is a rich country with gross domestic product
per person (GDP per capita) equal $26,980 as of 1995 (Case and Fair, page 522).&nbsp;
However, many people live in poverty, and some are without homes.&nbsp; The
government (both federal and state) pursues an inconsistent policy of
rhetorically encouraging work while at the same time paying welfare to only
those who do not earn much money from work, and by spending much of its budget
on transfer payments, yet not giving any money to some homeless people.&nbsp;
The paper resolves the inconsistency by providing a system that encourages
useful work while reducing and eventually eliminating poverty.</p>
<h3>Examination of Taxes and Tax rates</h3>
<p>Economic cost to a person of an action is a measure of decrease of pleasure
needed to achieve the action.&nbsp; Cost includes non-monetary items such as
tiredness from being at a job.</p>
<p>Many taxes are paid for the income.&nbsp; The amount a worker receives after
all taxes are paid is called disposable income.&nbsp; The amount of money
employer pays for employment (including all taxes) is called payroll expense.&nbsp;
Total income tax is payroll expense minus disposable income.&nbsp; FICA taxes,
although not officially called &quot;income tax&quot;, from economical point of
view have the effect of an income tax.&nbsp; Because of deductions and
exemptions, poor people usually do not pay the official income tax.&nbsp;
However, they pay 6.20% of their income as the social security tax and 1.45% as
Medicare tax for a total of 7.65%.&nbsp; (Source: &quot;2000 social
security&quot;) Not appearing on a tax form for the employee is the matching
contribution of the employer (7.65% of the income of the employee) for a total
of 2*7.65%/(100%+7.65%)=14.2% of the payroll expense.</p>
<p>This tax and not the formalities of to whom the tax is assigned matters
because the employee cares primarily about the net money he/she receives, and
the employer cares (holding worker quality to be fixed) primarily about the net
amount of money to pay.</p>
<p>Marginal income tax rate can be defined as the additional income tax divided
by increase in income.&nbsp; If such definition were used, marginal income tax
for the poor would be about 15%, which is quite low.</p>
<p>However, such calculation does not count the loss of welfare benefits to the
person.&nbsp; In real terms, marginal tax rate is <b><i>1-</i></b><i>(change of
total economical income due to work)<b>/</b>(change in payroll tax expense</i>).&nbsp;
Because the total income is much more relevant than the distribution of income
by source, the definition in this rather than the previous paragraph should be
used.</p>
<p>Income is best defined through the equation:&nbsp; <i>increase in net worth</i>
= <i>income </i><b>-</b><i>consumption</i>.&nbsp; Net worth is assets (not
counting one's body) minus liabilities.&nbsp; Consumption refers to all spending
including waste.&nbsp; (Case and Fair, page 433)</p>
<p>Defined this way, income includes welfare benefits such as social security
receipts, temporary assistance to needy families, unemployment compensation,
reduced medical cost due to Medicare and Medicaid, need-based public housing at
sub-market costs, food stamps, and college need-based financial aid.</p>
<h3>Welfare as Taxes</h3>
<p>Welfare benefits that are not monetary still provide subjective utility and,
thus, are counted.&nbsp; For example, while food stamps are not dollars, they
provide food, and families that have enough food can simply sell the stamps to
obtain monetary income.&nbsp; Unfortunately, benefits that are not monetary are
frequently not neutral and can, thus, adversely affect choices made by poor
households.&nbsp; For example, a household can select public housing even when a
private apartment is more suitable because public housing is subsidized while
the government does not subsidize private housing.</p>
<p>For the participants in public housing, rent is about 30% of their income.
(&quot;Basics of Public Housing&quot;)&nbsp; Thus, it provides a 30% real
marginal tax rate for those who select it (the poor people).</p>
<p>Food stamps supply cost of food for poor people.&nbsp; The benefits are
computed based on income: 30% of net income (gross income minus 20% deduction
and some other deductions) is spent on food.&nbsp; (The stamps are supposed to
cover the difference between the actual cost and this value.) Thus, food stamp
program provides 30%*(1-0.2)=24% income tax.&nbsp; If salary increases by $100,
benefits decrease about $24, which is the same as tax increase by $24.&nbsp;
Despite the financial discouragement of work by food stamps, work (any type will
satisfy) is a requirement for most of food stamps distribution.&nbsp; Source of
data:&nbsp; &quot;An Introduction about the Food Stamp Program&quot;.</p>
<p>Based on the data, real marginal tax rate is (2*7.65%+24%+30%)/(1+7.65%) = <b>64.4%</b>.
Thus, the regressive nature of welfare spending creates high real marginal tax
rate for poor people.&nbsp; The calculation does not include some
&quot;welfare&quot; benefits, Medicaid benefits, need-based college financial
aid, and other factors that increase the rate.&nbsp; Some of the benefits are
under condition of searching for work:&nbsp; While the government discourages
income from work (see below for explanation), much of the aid is cut off for
failing to find a job in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An institution that acts as welfare system (though it is not usually
recognized as such) is the prison system.&nbsp; Criminals (many of whom are not
eligible for normal welfare payments) are sent to prison where they have to be
provided (according to the Supreme Court) adequate nutrition, living
arrangements, and proper medical care.&nbsp; Lack of proper welfare system
combined with a good prison system encourages crime for poor people.&nbsp;
Crimes are inefficient for the society.&nbsp; Moreover, prisons are inefficient
because inmates are not allowed to leave even when the society would benefit
from such action.&nbsp; A guaranteed minimum income for those who are not
prisoners will reduce the incentive to commit crimes and, thus, will reduce
crime.</p>
<h3>Inefficiency of the Current Welfare System</h3>
<p>The high real marginal tax rate creates inefficiency by distorting the
decision on whether to work.&nbsp; Ideally, a person should work if the
opportunity cost of working is less than marginal revenue product of the job.&nbsp;
A person will be hired if and only if additional payroll expense (MPE) is less
than marginal product revenue (MRP):&nbsp; MPE&lt;MRP; in other words, employers
will hire when the benefits of hiring exceed the costs.&nbsp; A person will work
more if and only if marginal income (MI) is greater than marginal opportunity
cost of the job (MC):&nbsp; MI&gt;MC.&nbsp; (The person sacrifices leisure and
rest to get a job.)&nbsp; Marginal income is (1-real marginal tax rate)*MPE:&nbsp;
MI = (1-R)*MPE.&nbsp; Combining the equations,&nbsp; (1-R)*MPE&gt;MC, MPE&gt;MC/(1-R),
MRP&gt;MC/(1-R),</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>MRP/MC&gt;1/(1-R)</b>.&nbsp; This equation is the condition for
employment in a market system.&nbsp; For example, if real marginal tax rate is
64%, then 1/(1-R)=2.77, and a person will not work even if the benefit (to the
employer) of work is twice (or even 2.7 times as large as) the opportunity cost
of work.</p>
<p>The inefficiency is proportional to the amount of work forgone because of it
(roughly proportional to R), and the net inefficiency per unit of work forgone
(roughly proportional to R.)&nbsp; Thus, the total inefficiency is roughly
proportional to R<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, such rates are grossly unfair to those who work hard forty hours
per week and receive only slightly more economic income than those who do not
work at all.&nbsp; People should be rewarded for being valuable to the society.</p>
<h3>Proposed Solution and Its Benefits</h3>
<p>Consequently, real marginal tax rates for low-income people should be
lowered.&nbsp; Current accounting system for income taxes and welfare is
confusing:&nbsp; Estimating real marginal tax rate requires several pages of
economical analysis, and people are typically misled by the 'official' income
tax rates.&nbsp; The system should be simplified as follows.&nbsp; Because, at
cetera paribus, utility for one person is not more important than for another
person, and because in a democratic government system every person has the same
number of votes, welfare benefits should be given equally to all people.&nbsp;
All taxes on income should be united into a single income tax, given to the
employee.</p>
<p>Then, more equitable marginal tax rates should be given.&nbsp; For simplicity
(to reduce administrative costs), to reduce tax avoidance (due to different tax
rates), and for equity, income tax should be a flat rate tax.&nbsp; The amount
of tax and welfare benefits should be selected to make government budget
approximately balance.&nbsp; Welfare benefits should not be taxed because they
are the same for all people, because taxation of welfare benefits simply reduces
the effective benefits, and because making stated and actual benefits equal
simplifies decision-making.</p>
<p>Most of the other welfare receipts should be eliminated because of
inefficiency.&nbsp; For example, social security system for old people
encourages able and productive old people to retire instead of benefiting the
society through work.&nbsp; Medicare should be replaced by private insurance
(with some regulation of medical insurance companies if needed).&nbsp; The money
for retirement savings and medical insurance can come from the income received
as welfare.</p>
<p>The value of the benefits should be such as to satisfy the basic needs of the
vast majority of poor people.&nbsp; The basic needs are:&nbsp; sufficient food
to satisfy the nutritional needs (food is cheap, a surplus of farmers exists in
the USA, nutritional food improves productivity and health), clothing
(sufficient in amount to prevent suffering from cold, and of sufficient quality
to prevent repudiation by the public and prospective employers), housing (a
small room as in college dormitories is enough), and opportunity for advancement
(access to books and part-time access to computers with internet access will
suffice).&nbsp; The basic needs are distinguished from additional wants that are
not necessary.&nbsp; For example, a person may want Playstation 2 for
entertainment but can clearly live normally without it.</p>
<p>To become successful adults, children need to satisfy their basic needs.&nbsp;
For example, education is necessary for almost all jobs.&nbsp; Proper nutrition
is needed for good health.&nbsp; Additionally, children are human beings and
their sufferings are as important as sufferings of other people.&nbsp; Moreover,
children are not responsible for their poverty since they should not (according
to the laws) work for a living.&nbsp; Therefore, no efficiency incentives exist
to keep children poor.&nbsp; No child should live in poverty.&nbsp; Yet, 21.2%
of children live in poverty as of 1995 (Case and Fair, page 413).&nbsp; The
reform would give children same benefits as adults and should eliminate poverty
in children.&nbsp; The money will be allocated to the child, or to the extent
the child is incompetent, to the parents; or to the extent the parents are
incompetent, to the state government on behalf of the child.</p>
<h3>Possible Concerns about the Plan</h3>
<p><i>Should taxes rates be progressive rather than flat because it is unfair to
tax the poor as much as the rich?</i>&nbsp; If the tax rate is flat, the rich
pay much more than the poor-a person with yearly income $1 million pays 100
times as much as a person of income $10,000.&nbsp; At the same time, both
receive approximately the same government services.&nbsp; The frequent concern
above is based on the confusion between flat rate tax and flat amount tax.</p>
<p><i>Is guaranteeing at least a subsistence standard of living an incentive not
to work because people will survive regardless of whether they work? </i>&nbsp;A
system of minimum guaranteed benefits through programs like food stamps, public
shelter, and prisons already exists.&nbsp; It has to exist because the poor need
(where the need is measured in utility rather than dollars) resources much more
than the rich, and because poor have the same number of votes as the rich.&nbsp;
The reforms proposed should increase the amount of work that people will do.</p>
<p><i>Since families will receive additional benefits if they have children,
will families have too many children to obtain more benefits? </i>&nbsp;As
stated above, no child should live in poverty.&nbsp; If a woman is pregnant and
the expected result (a child) is desirable, then the woman made the right
choice, even if for the wrong reasons.&nbsp; If the expected result is
undesirable, the woman should be forced to have an abortion to prevent the
undesirable result and, thus, improve the society.&nbsp; Such policy (or a good
alternative to it) will fully address the concern.&nbsp; It should be
implemented gradually to avoid controversy.</p>
<p><i>Will the reforms provide money for people to use drugs?</i>&nbsp; (Drug,
as used in this paper, is a substance that not only harms its user, but that can
make the user addicted to it.)&nbsp; A solution to give benefits under a
condition not to use the drugs is cruel because most addicts are psychologically
unable to stop usage.&nbsp; Instead, the government should force all drug
addicts to undergo treatment.&nbsp; A proper treatment program will save
hundreds of billions of dollars for drug usage and fully address the concern.</p>
<p><i>Will the redistribution program increase size of the government and cause
bureaucratic inefficiency?</i>&nbsp; On the contrary, some government programs
will be eliminated, and welfare will be streamlined as providing money to the
poor.&nbsp; Simply writing checks to people does not require many government
workers.</p>
<p><i>Will the reform greatly increase total government spending?</i>&nbsp; The
welfare benefit is in place of other programs and, thus, the required increase
in government spending is not too large (currently half of government budget are
transfer payments; that part will be replaced).&nbsp; The increased efficiency
and the reduction of poverty will cause people to work more (and, thus, pay more
taxes).&nbsp; The change will allow increased government spending to coexist
with lower tax rates without budget deficits.</p>
<p><i>Will replacing the transfer programs with a single program eliminate
useful functions of the government?</i>&nbsp; The transfer programs are like the
proposed program plus inefficiency.&nbsp; However, one of the most important
functions of government is to subsidize activities (such activities are called
positive externalities) where cost is smaller than benefit to the society but
larger than revenue to the firm.&nbsp; That function will remain fully intact.&nbsp;
Part of its funding will come on negative externalities-if marginal cost to the
society of making a product is greater than marginal cost to a firm, the firm
should be required to pay the difference as tax.&nbsp; Such tax will reduce
usage of harmful products.</p>
<p><i>Can the reform have unpredictable results?</i>&nbsp; The reform should
occur gradually to determine the optimal welfare system without risking a
depression.&nbsp; Gradualism will allow precise determination about which
current welfare programs should remain.</p>
<p>The government should set up a single flat rate income tax (in addition to
taxes on land and negative externalities).&nbsp; The tax should be used to
supply welfare payments equally to all people, and to fund positive
externalities (including public goods).&nbsp; The welfare will promote
efficiency and will reduce human suffering.&nbsp; In several decades, it should
cause elimination of poverty in the United States and eventually full
satisfaction of basic human needs on Earth.</p>
