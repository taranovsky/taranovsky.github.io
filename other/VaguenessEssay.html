<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the Largest Small Number</H1>
<P>	Sorites paradoxes pose fundamental questions about semantics of natural
languages.  The sorites paradox regarding numbers is the following: 
One is a small number.  If n is a small number, then n+1 is a small
number since there is nothing fundamentally different between n and
n+1.  Therefore, every number is small.</P>
<P>	The problem in the argument lies in the induction step.  Although (for
large n) n and n+1 are similar quantities, they are not the same, and
in some cases, the difference is decisive.  Imagine, for example,
placing coins one by one into a large bag that cannot withstand a
heavy weight.  A single coin ordinarily does not make a significant
difference; the weight of 137 coins is almost the same as that of
138.  Yet, after say the 12345<SUP>th</SUP> coin is placed, the bag
snaps.  Clearly, in this context  the difference between 12344 and
12345 is crucial.  We may say that 12345 coins are too heavy while
12344 are not.  The difference between 12344 and 12345 acquires
significance from context.</P>
<P>	Hidden sharp differences between adjacent numbers occur in many other
contexts.  For a example, if a typical today's computer counts events
and records the count as (unsigned) integer data type, then after
reaching the count of 4294967295, the next event resets the counted
number of events to zero.  In a sense,  2^32=4294967296 is the least
large number since it is the least natural number that cannot be
stored in the standard 32-bit word size.</P>
<P>	Our ordinary usage of word “small” is amalgamation of the usage and
meaning in particular cases.  In general, as the number increases,
the case for saying “not small” gradually increases until at some
tipping point, it is better to say “not small” than to say
“small”.  In many cases, the exact boundary is more hidden than
in the particular cases described above.  However, some
boundary is necessary for correct logic to work, and  hence must
exist.  The boundary between small and not small must exist in every
formal language (that uses classical logic and semantics) that has
predicate small. </P>
<P>	It is unclear, however, whether such a boundary is a natural one, or merely
exists formally.  One view is that the general boundaries of vague
terms exist only with respect to formal languages.   On that view,
utterances are true and false only with respect to formal languages. 
Much rather like the sentence “the number of apples in that bin is
small,” can be meaningless in itself for failing to specify the
bin, on the formal view it is also meaningless without specification
of what is apple and what is small.  In ordinary conversation and
thought, we assume formal existence of the language  but do not
specify it.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, the formal view appears to be nihilist in nature for it appears to
allow semantics of natural languages only as a formal fiction.  For
example, a proponent of the formal view may say, “Formally, laws do
not exist, but since appearance of laws is necessary, judges should
pretend that laws exist.”</P>
<P>	One can attempt to avoid the dilemma by saying that in clear cases, human
language has natural semantics while in borderline cases it has
semantics only relative to formal languages.  Unfortunately, the
attempt does not work because one can ask, what is the smallest
natural number n such that the sentence “Generally speaking, n is a
small number” does not have a natural truth value.  The border
between a vague statement being naturally true and being true only
with respect to a formal language is as problematic as the border
between truth and falsehood.</P>
<P>	The problem of vagueness also arises in morality, for one can ask about
the exact boundary between right and wrong.  One is forced to
conclude either that morality is merely a matter of convention and of
formal choice of the definition of wrong—which is unacceptable—or
hold that some actions are wrong in themselves, irrespective of the
formal  language, which by the argument in the paragraph above,
implies a sharp boundary between wrong and not wrong, and hence
contradicts the spirit of the formal approach to semantics.</P>
<P>	For these reasons, the author is inclined to believe that human languages
have natural semantics.  The question, “what is the largest small
number” has a single best answer in the general case (however,
since human language is context dependent, context can override the
general answer), and the United States legal code has a single best
interpretation.  </P>
<P>	The argument against the natural view is that we do not see how we can
determine the boundary.  However, human civilization has made an
enormous intellectual progress, and incomparably greater progress is
still to come.  The progress is sometimes accompanied by a conceptual
shift, which allows us to see what before we thought cannot be seen. 
For example, in a primitive society one can maintain that matter has
no structure at a micrometer level since there is no way we can
distinguish structure at a micrometer level—by sight, touch, or any
other then conceivable means.  However, modern inventions such as
microscopes allow seeing sub-micrometer structure of matter.   </P>
<P>	In another example, theory of relativity is (wrongly) claimed by some to
imply there there is no such thing as the frame of rest since results
of physical experiments are believed to be independent of the frame
of reference.  However, more recently, scientists have discovered a
field permeating the universe—cosmic background radiation.  By
measuring (frequency) Doppler shift at different directions, one can
find our velocity relative to the source, which arguably is our
actual velocity.</P>
<P>	Perhaps, future advances will open our minds to a new and fundamentally
different way of understanding semantics of the English language. 
Alternatively, if we take polls asking people “what is the largest
small number,” the distribution of results will grow progressively
narrower as human civilization advances in knowledge and
intelligence, and eventually most people will give the same,
presumably correct answer.</P>
