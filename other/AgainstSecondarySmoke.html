<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center">For allowing people to force others
not to smoke in their presence</h1>
<p><b>Thesis:</b> Most nonsmokers suffer from secondary smoke. Allowing the
people to force others not to smoke in their presence would solve the problem.</p>
<p>Tobacco smoke is a very dangerous poison. It contains at least 43
carcinogens. Smoking, on average, quadruples the chance of oral and laryngeal
cancer. It also increases the chance of cancer in organs not involved in
smoking, such as stomach. Smoking also significantly increases the chance of
emphysema. It contributes to heart disease and many respiratory diseases such as
chronic bronchitis. Smoking causes lung cancer: It causes 87% of lung cancers,
and 27% of all cancer deaths are from lung cancer.</p>
<p>There is no difference between inhaling one's own smoke and someone else's
smoke except that in most cases one's own smoke is more concentrated. Thus, the
effects described above apply to the secondary smoke. Almost everyone is exposed
to the secondary smoke. Secondary smoke causes thousands of American deaths
every year:&nbsp; &quot;Each year about 3000 nonsmoking adults die of lung
cancer as a result of breathing the second-hand smoke from others'
cigarettes.&quot;<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
These people die because they were repeatedly poisoned by the smoke without
their consent: They are murdered except that the acts by the smokers are legal.</p>
<p>The proposed law will eliminate that. Moreover, it will significantly reduce
smoking. Below is a part by part examination and explanation of the law.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><b>Section 1:</b> In all public places and in workplace, any person may
require any other person not to smoke if the smoke affects the first person.
Except when breathing smoked air is necessary for job performance, no employment
contract may require a person to accept smoking and no employee may be punished
for not accepting smoking.</p>
<p><b>Justification:</b> The proposed law states that people in public places
have a right not to be poisoned or having to move to an inferior place. The
right not to be poisoned is an essential right. Thus, the law will be very
beneficial to those who do not smoke. Since the law is likely to decrease
smoking in public places and thus smoking in general, it is beneficial for
smokers. The law can be enforced since at least one person (and often several)
is a victim and a witness.</p>
<p>People in the workplace are given many rights, such as having at least the
minimum wage. The right not to be poisoned should be one of them. The last
sentence is needed to prevent employers from indirectly circumventing the law.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><b>Section 2:</b> No person may smoke if he or she
knows or should know that the smoke is affecting a person under
the age of 18.</p>
<p><b>Justification:</b>  As described above, a
person has the right to prevent other people from putting smoke in the person's
lungs. People under the age of 18 are forbidden to smoke. Thus, they do not have a
right to choose whether to create and inhale cigarette smoke. That is they
should not have a right to choose on whether to inhale someone's smoke: They
should not have a right to give consent to secondhand smoke. Thus, if a person
knows that a minor inhales his or her smoke, the person knows that this is
without consent, and the person should be required to stop smoking. Note:
Certain limited exceptions may be added to this section.</p>
<p>An important place where children are exposed to the secondary smoke is their
home. Smoke is particularly damaging to children since they are developing.
Secondary smoke can cause severe respiratory disorders and hinder lung growth.
These effects are often permanent (last for a lifetime).<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
Each year, secondary smoke &quot;causes up to 300,000 children to suffer from
lower tract respiratory infection.&quot;<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
Thus, parents who smoke much in the presence of their children make the children
handicapped. This should not be allowed. Additionally, &quot;The most common
situation for first trying a cigarette is with a friend who already smokes&quot;
<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
The law may eliminate the cause since children will no longer be exposed to
smoke (at least legally).</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><b>Section 3:</b> No person may smoke if the smoke
interferes with private territory or property without prior consent of the
owner(s). The owner(s) may not give the consent if he/she/they know(s) or should
know that a child will inhale the smoke. If the situation changes such that a
child will be exposed to the smoke, the owner(s) must revoke the consent.</p>
<p>This section is already justified by the justifications for the sections 1
and 2: An owner of a private territory should have a right not to be poisoned.
From the point of view of this section, the most important type of private property
is apartments. Due to poor ventilation, smoke often moves from one apartment
to another. The last two sentences of
the section are needed to ensure that children in apartments are not chronically
exposed to tobacco smoke from other apartments</p>
<p>Section 4 is for the enforcement of the law. It states:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">Violators of Sections 1-3 are responsible for the damage (including emotional and indirect damage)
they had made and reasonable investigation, attorney, and court costs and
sentenced accordingly.</p>
<p>Section 5 states:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">No pregnant woman may smoke. No pregnant woman may
purposefully inhale smoke to achieve its effects. All pregnant women must
take reasonable action to prevent inhaling smoke if they are exposed to a
large amount of secondary smoke. The courts shall provide an appropriate
punishment for the people who violate the law. The section does not apply if the
woman has no good evidence that she is pregnant.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:9.35pt;margin-bottom:.1in;margin-left:
0in">Justification: &quot;Other research has shown that mothers who smoke give
birth more frequently to premature or underweight babies, probably because of a
decrease in blood flow to the placenta.&quot;<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>
Every year, 5 million years of potential lifetime is destroyed by premature
deaths from smoking.<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
Thus, smoking pregnant women negatively affect their children through smoking.
This should not be permitted since according to the justification of section 2,
mothers should not have a right to damage their child.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><b>Section 6:</b> The courts may order people who
are found repeatedly violating this law (expect the owner for violating section
3 and the employer for violating sentence 2 of section 1) not to smoke. Every
person who is, because of this law, forced not to smoke must be provided an
appropriate treatment free of charge. If necessary or if requested by the
violator, the treatment center will detain him (and treat him well during the
detainment) during the withdrawal period.</p>
<p><b>Justification:</b> This section is necessary for effective enforcement and
reduction of smoking. Heavy nicotine addicts might not be able to control their
smoking. Causing them not to smoke would prevent the repeated violations. It
would also benefit the smokers since smoking is bad. Simply forbidding smoking
for those people would not be very effective since they are not able to control
their smoking. The treatment centers will help them to do that. For some, even
some lessons to help quitting smoking may not be enough. However, their
detainment during the withdrawal period will ensure that they will not restart
smoking because of their addiction to nicotine, a mental illness. The section
implies that the people who are required to stop smoking but do not do so can be
forced to participate in a reasonable treatment center or (if the people refuse
treatment) be put in jail.</p>
<p>Additionally, children who smoke are violating section 2 of the proposed law.
Thus, if they are repeatedly caught smoking, they can be made not to smoke,
which is an effective measure since others failed. For the maximum benefit of
the law, it is essential that everyone participates in its enforcement. Lack of
condemnation of criminals is one of the main reasons why some laws are poorly
enforced. Similar laws should be passed in most private places such as
restaurants. The first sentence of section 1 cannot be extended to private places since
accepting smoke may be a condition of admittance to the property. In some
private places, the laws already exist.</p>

<p><b><u>Appendix:</u></b><br>
Author of the proposed law: Dmytro Taranovsky<br>
Date: January 12, 2000; slightly modified on July 29, 2002.</p>
<p>A law to restrict smoking when it interferes with other people:</p>
<p>Section 1: In all public places and in workplace, any person may require any
other person not to smoke if the smoke affects the first person. Except when
breathing smoke is necessary for job performance, no employment contract may
require a person to accept smoking and no employee may be punished for not
accepting smoking.</p>
<p>Section 2: No person may smoke if he or she knows or should know that the
smoke is affecting a person under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Section 3: No person may smoke if the smoke interferes with private territory
or property without prior consent of the owner(s). The owner(s) may not give the
consent if he/she/they know(s) or should know that a child will inhale the
smoke. If the situation changes such that a child will be exposed to the smoke,
the owner(s) must revoke the consent.</p>
<p>Section 4: Violators of Sections 1-3 are
responsible for the damage (including emotional and indirect damage) they had
made and reasonable investigation, attorney, and court costs and sentenced
accordingly.</p>
<p>Section 5: No pregnant woman may smoke. No pregnant woman may purposefully
inhale smoke to achieve its effects. All pregnant women must take
reasonable action to prevent inhaling smoke if they are exposed to a large
amount of secondary smoke. The courts shall provide an appropriate punishment
for the people who violate the law. The section does not apply if the woman has
no good evidence that she is pregnant.</p>
<p>Section 6: The courts may order people who
are found repeatedly violating this law (expect the owner for violating section
3 and the employer for violating sentence 2 of section 1) not to smoke. Every
person who is, because of this law, forced not to smoke must be provided an
appropriate treatment free of charge. If necessary or if requested by the
violator, the treatment center will detain him (and treat him well during the
detainment) during the withdrawal period.</p>
