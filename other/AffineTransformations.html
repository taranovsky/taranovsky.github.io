<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Invertible Affine Transformations in Geometry</H2>
<P>Transformations are very useful in geometry. They are used
as follows:
<OL>
	<LI>Check if the problem conditions are invariant under the
	transformation. The transformation can be used only if they
	are. 
	<LI>Use the transformation to change to change the problem into a
	simpler one. 
</OL>
<P>The most frequently used set of transformations consist of all
transformations that leave distance invariant, called congruence
transformations. </P>
<P>Invertible affine transformation is:
<OL>
	<LI>A congruence transformation;
	<LI>Multiplying the y coordinate of every point by the same non-zero
	number: a*y-->y; or
	<LI>Any combination of 1 and 2.
</OL>
<P>The transformation leaves many conditions invariant, specifically:
<UL>
	<LI>Colinearity or coplanarity of a set of points: Lines
	are transformed into lines; planes-into planes; parallel lines or
      planes--into parallel lines or planes.
	<LI>Ratio of lengths for the segments on the same or parallel
	lines.
	<LI>Ratio of areas on the same or parallel planes.
	<LI>Ratio of volumes if the space is three-dimensional.
	<LI>Center of mass is transformed into center of mass.
</UL>
<P>The following sets of figures can be transformed into each other
using the transformation:
<UL>
	<LI>All tetrahedrons and thus all triangles.
	<LI>All parallelepipeds and thus all parallelograms.
</UL>
<P>The properties above can be easily proved.</P>
<P><B>Example:</B> For a tetrahedron, a bimedian is a segment
from a vertex to the intersection of medians on the opposite face.
Prove that for every tetrahedron, all bimedians intersect at one
point that divides each bimedian in a 3:1 ratio starting at the
vertex; moreover, the intersection is the center of mass of the
tetrahedron, and it divides the tetrahedron into 4 tetrahedrons of
equal volume.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B> All of the conditions are invariant under
all invertible affine transformations. Since all tetrahedrons
are equivalent under the transformation, the tetrahedron can be
transformed into regular tetrahedron of side length 1 without loss of
generality. The theorem (except 3:1 ratio) follows from the
symmetry. The 3:1 ratio can be easily verified for the regular
tetrahedron.</P>
