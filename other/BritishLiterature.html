<P>People read literature to obtain pleasure.&#160; They call
pleasure many different names such as satisfaction, delight, and
insight.&#160; Since people seek pleasure, enjoyment (at least for a
part of the audience) is a requisite for a literature work.&#160;
Works of literature provide pleasure not by direct consumption, for
they are simply black symbols on white paper.&#160; Instead, they
provide beautiful mental images, suspense, and pleasure of greater
understanding of the world and human nature.&#160;&#160; A work of
art is an object (such as a book) that provides its utility indirectly--through its message.&#160; Because many works of British
writers during the period provide pleasure, they are valid and good
works of literature.</P>
<P>In Romanticism, enjoyment is provided through strong feelings.&#160;
The feelings overwhelm the reality and thus provide an emotional
escape from everyday life.</P>
<P>Literature during the Victorian era is characterized by
traditional methods of giving pleasure.&#160; The authors used
suspense.&#160; They reduced depression of the readers through works
that display abundant energy.&#160; They also give valuable lessons
about life through their works.</P>
<P>The Modern period is best characterized by bold experimentation of
the ways to capture the reader.&#160; For example, some poems become
fragmented and display clear images without formal transition between
scenes.&#160; 
</P>
<P>A major disagreement about writing literature works is the amount
of mental processing that should be used to extract the pleasure.&#160;
During much of the history, those who read well were the elite who
accepted much mental processing for reading.&#160; However, always,
but especially in the twentieth century, many readers want books that
are easy to read and that are interesting without the need for
research and special analysis.</P>
<P>All these techniques are valid because they provide enjoyment to
some readers.&#160; However, different readers have different
personalities and thus enjoy (and read) different works.&#160; For
example, <I>Finnegans Wake</I> by James Joyce is a work of literature
because it causes deep analysis by some readers.&#160; Some of the
other people, however, should not read it because the novel does not
make much sense.</P>
