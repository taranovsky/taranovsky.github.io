<h2><a id="A1">Introduction and Outline</h2>
<p>Despite vast advances in set theory and mathematics in general, the language of set theory, which is also the language of mathematics, has remained the same since the beginning of modern set theory and first order logic. That formal language has served us well, but it is of necessity limited, and does not adequately deal with properties for which there is no set of all objects satisfying the property. The purpose of this paper is to address the deficiencies in the expressive power of ordinary set theory with extensions no more doubtful than set theory itself.</p>
<p>The second section discusses incompleteness and inexpressibility in general and does not include formal results. Next, we introduce logic that allows some self-reference but with limitations to prevent loops and infinite regress. The logic is more expressive than (a formulation of) infinitary logic. We show that levels of infinitary logic correspond to levels of almost self-referential logic and levels of constructible hierarchy above V. We also use large cardinals to get reflection principles, and use reflection principles to axiomatize extensions to the language of set theory. The last section discusses several approaches to proper classes, and shows how these approaches are enriched by the material in this paper.</p>
<p>Further reading can be found in [1], which presents powerful extensions to set theory and discusses additional topics.</p>

<h2><a id="A2">Incompleteness and Inexpressibility</h2>
<p>Introduction of formal languages and axiomatic systems into mathematics has created the necessary precision in the language of mathematics and its methods. However, every formal language fails to express some mathematical claims and every (recursive) sufficiently expressive axiomatic system is incomplete. By Tarski's theorem on undefinability of truth, a language cannot express its own truth predicate. By Godel's incompleneteness theorem, every recusive sufficiently expressive consistent formal system is incomplete and cannot prove its own consistency.</p>
<p>To avoid incompleteness, some had proposed to strengthen the deductive apparatus. For example, Hilbert proposed the use of ω-rule, which allows inferring ∀n∈N φ(n) when for every natural number n, φ(n) can be inferred. However, if new deductive apparatus is not recursive, then to be useable by mathematicians, a proof in the new deductive system would have to include a demonstration that it is a valid proof. To achieve the necessary precision and to avoid basic disagreements that plague many other fields (such as philosophy), philosophical arguments in mathematics must be separated from ordinary mathematical deduction. Thus, the demonstration has to be formally verifiable relative to the accepted or specified axioms and the system is reduced to a recursive one. Every recursive system can be rephrased to be a recursive system of axioms with first order logic, so without loss of generality, we can limit ourselves to first order logic and recursive axiom schemes.</p>
<p>The expressive power of a language is determined by the objects that are described by the language and the properties expressible in the language. It turns out that in mathematics as we know it, all mathematical objects are sets or are reducible to sets, more precisely (if there are other kinds of sets) extensional well-founded sets built from the empty set (for proper classes, see last section). A discovery of a mathematical object that is not reducible to sets would be revolutionary and unlikely. The (first order) language of set theory consists of first order logic and the binary relation of membership (equality is definable using extensionality). That language is the de facto formal language of mathematics, and, in cases of doubt, meaningfulness of other formal languages is usually established by reduction to that language. Thus, the problem of inexpressibility in mathematics is essentially the problem of how to increase expressiveness of the language of set theory, and the solution is finding and formalizing properties of sets that are not expressible in that language. The reasons above also show that incompleteness in mathematics is incompleteness in set theory.</p>
<p>Extensions to the language of set theory that are presented here can be formally defined by a statement in the extended language such that the statement uniquely fixes the extension. Moreover, except for the general extension, their meaningfulness can be established by a basic argument from contradiction. One shows that regardless of the truth value of a formula for variousparameters and regardless of for which parameters the formula is well-defined, a contradiction arises if we assume that for some parameters the formula is not well-defined. A sample contradiction might be: φ(3) is not well-defined, but φ(2) is well-defined, and φ(3) is defined to equal φ(2). Although the notion of "well-defined" is not well-defined, the argument of contradiction does not depend on the particular notion of well-defined but only on its basic properties. Moreover, "well-defined" is applied here only to formal languages whose semantics is formally specified.</p>
<p>A large class of true statements, namely reflection principles, forms a natural hierarchy. The notion of a reflection principle is informal. A reflection principle is a statement that such and such natural theory has a sufficiently well-behaved (in a canonical way) model. It turns out that a reflection principle implies all reflection principles of lower strength and expression level, including the restriction of more expressive but weaker principles to lower expression level (except at the expressive level of large cardinals when it is unstated whether the cumulative hierarchy reaches the cardinals). A sufficiently strong reflection principle resolves all basic incompleteness at its expression level (at least if the expression level is not too high; at Σ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>level one would need to combine a reflection principle with a forcing statement such as the Continuum Hypothesis). For example, projective determinacy resolves the basic incompleteness for Σ<sup>1</sup><sub>&lt;ω</sub> formulas. The incompleteness addressed in this paper is at high expression level rather than high strength and is addressed using reflection principles.</p>

<h2><a id="A3">Almost Self-Referential Formulas</h2>

<h3>The First Extension</h3>
<p>Let Tr be the satisfaction relation for one parameter formulas of ordinary set theory. By Tarski's theorem of undefinability of truth, Tr is not definable in ordinary set theory, so let us consider adding it to the language. Almost self-referential logic can be seen as a generalization and iteration of this extension. We have to show that Tr is well-defined. Necessarily, the demonstration is a philosophical, not a formal mathematical one. However, the philosophical argument corresponds to a mathematical proof that the extension is well-defined when the domain is a set. If Tr is not well-defined, then there is a code n such that Tr(n) is not well-defined, but Tr(n)↔φ for a formula φ in ordinary set theory and so must be well-defined since φ is well-defined; φ is well-defined since 'there exist', 'or', 'not', 'in', and 'set' are (assumed to be) well-defined.</p>
<p>To axiomatize this extension, we add axioms to the effect that Tr is a satisfaction relation and the replacement axiom schema for formulas involving Tr. The replacement schema is true for the same reasons that ordinary replacement is true, for the intent is to allow arbitrary relationsin the replacement. The extension of ZFC is weaker than ZFC + there is an inaccessible cardinal. However, the extension resolves some incompleteness at a very high expression level, so some of its consequences (in the ordinary language) are not provable from ZFC + there is a proper class of supercompact cardinals if the later is consistent.</p>
<p>For example, by applying replacement to n→"the least κ such that V<sub>κ</sub> is Σ<sub>n</sub> correct" we obtain a level of the cumulative hierarchy that is an elementary substructure of V (with respect to the membership relation). (The n in Σ<SUB>n</SUB> refers to the number of unbounded quantifiers.) By contrast, because of the incompleteness theorem, ZFC + there is a proper class of supercompact cardinals (if consistent) does not prove the existence of a model of "ZFC + there is a proper class of supercompact cardinals" and hence does not prove existence of a Σ<SUB>4</SUB> correct model of ZFC (the large cardinal statement is Π<SUB>4</SUB>).</p>

<h3>Almost Self-Referential Formulas</h3>
<p>Simple self-reference is not allowed since otherwise the utterance "This statement is false" would lead to a paradox. On the other hand, properties can be defined inductively. For example, 2<sup>n</sup> is 2<sup>n-1</sup> if n&gt;0 and 1 if n=0. Such reference is possible because the parameters are varied on a well-founded path. In general, variation on a non-well-founded path is forbidden since the definition f(n) ↔ ∀m&gt;n ¬f(m) is self-contradictory (the quantification is over natural numbers). A formalization of the allowed self-reference is:</p>
<p><b>Definition:</b> Almost Self-Referential Formula<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Syntax:</span>Consists of the formula proper φ, a binary relation R, and a parameter x. The relation is an ordinary formula with markings to indicate the arguments. The formula proper is like an ordinary formula except that it may contain a special unary predicate symbol f.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Semantics:</span>The truth-value of φ is computed as if it is an ordinary formula. To compute f(a), let R<sub>w</sub> be the well-founded part of R: R<sub>w</sub>(x, y) iff R(x, y) and there is no infinite sequence y, y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>,..., such that R(y<sub>1</sub>, y) and R(y<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and ... . f(a) is false if not R<sub>w</sub>(a, x); otherwise, f(a) is the value of the original formula with x replaced by a.</p>
<p>For example, x is a power of 2 is denoted by (x=1 ∨ (x is even ∧ f(x/2)), R is &lt; restricted to natural numbers). To allow syntax to be algorithmically verifiable, we do not require R to be well-founded.</p>
<p>Consider the language of set theory extended with the satisfaction relation for one parameter almost self-referential formulas. To see that the extension is meaningful, suppose that the relation (and hence a particular almost self-referential formula) is not well-defined. Since R<sub>w</sub> is well-defined and well-founded, there must be a minimal x for which the formula is not well-defined. Since the formula proper is like an ordinary formula, that can only happen if an invocation of f, say with parameter y, is not well-defined. If not R<sub>w</sub>(y, x), then f(y) is false and hence well-defined. Otherwise, R<sub>w</sub>(y, x) holds, so by minimality of x, the almost self-referential formula with y in place of x, and hence f(y), is well-defined. Therefore, the extension is meaningful. The extension is meaningful whenever the base theory includes basic set theory and the notion of being well-founded, and in particular is meaningful for second order arithmetic. The expressive power will be analyzed, and an axiomatization presented in the next section.</p>

<h3>Infinitary Logic</h3>
<p>A different extension is through the satisfaction relation for infinitary logic. An infinitary formula (also called a formula in L<sub>∞ω</sub>) is like an ordinary formula except that disjunctions (and conjunctions) may consist of infinitely many terms (such as x=1 or x=2 or x=3 or ...). Since infinite formulas cannot be written on paper, one has to work with finite representations of the formulas. The most natural way to doso is to identify infinitary formulas with sets and work with the satisfaction relation. Satisfaction relation for infinitary sentences is just as expressive but is less convenient for analyzing restrictions of infinitary logic. More on infinitary logic can be found in [2].</p>

<h2><a id="A4">Expressive Power of the Extensions</h2>

<h3>Constructible Hierarchy Above V</h3>
<p>The expressive power of almost self-referential logic is best explored using transitive models. Consider a transitive model V—meant to represent the universe—of ZFC or ZFC minus power set. We assume that V satisfies the replacement schema for formulas in the extension we are considering. L<sub>α</sub>(V) is level α of the constructible hierarchy built above V. The expressive power of a logic is measured by what subsets of V are definable in V (in that logic, with parameters). For infinitary logic, we only include formulas that are in V. For precision we consider the following modification of almost self-referential logic: The formula and the predicate f has two parameters; thefirst parameter is used for the relation R; when the formula is called with only one parameter, R is evaluated as true.</p>
<p>With these assumptions, we state</p>
<p><b>Theorem: </b>For every non-zero ordinal α in V and set S⊂V, the following are equivalent</p>
<ol><li>S ∈ L<sub>α</sub>(V)<li>S is expressible in infinitary logic with formulas restricted to rank less than ωα.</li>
<li>S is expressible in almost self-referential logic with the well-founded relation restricted to a rank less than ωα.</li></ol>
<p>For the well-founded relations used in almost self-referential formulas, the most important property is rank. (The length or rank of proper class relations can be compared inductively using almost self-referential logic.) For natural extensions and fragments, expressive power is linearly ordered by the allowed rank. <b></b>For example, if require that R is the membership relation restricted to the ordinals, then the expressive power is still a bit above that of infinitary logic.</p>
<p>The satisfaction relation of almost self-referential logic is definable in second order logic about V. The definition can be chosen to be absolute for every transitive extension of V satisfying enough set theory. In fact, ZF minus power set with replacement and separation limited to Σ<sub>1</sub><sup>ZF</sup> formulas suffices. The absoluteness derives from absoluteness of well-foundedness for transitive models satisfying enough set theory and from the constructive nature of the proof of uniqueness of the almost self-referential extension.</p>

<h3>Axiomatization of Extensions</h3>
<p>The extensions can be axiomatized by extending the replacement schema to all the formulas in the language, and by astatement in the extended language that uniquely fixes the language. For example, onlythe satisfaction relation Trsatisfies the recursive definition of the satisfaction relation. The axiomatization is weaker than existence of inaccessible cardinals since for every inaccessible cardinal κ, full second order logic is meaningful about V<SUB>κ</SUB> and V<SUB>κ</SUB> satisfies full second order replacement. However, stronger axiomatizations can be obtained using reflection principles.</p>
<p>Notice that of the extensions considered, if extension A is more expressive than extension B, and if V satisfies replacement schema for A (and power set), then V also satisfies, "there is a level of the cumulative hierarchy, V<sub>κ</sub>, that satisfies all true statements expressible in extension B." Therefore, without fear of falsehood, we can axiomatize an extension A by augmenting ZFC with the axiom schema: If ZFC proves that "every V<sub>κ</sub> satisfying ZFC and replacement for all formulas in A also satisfies φ", then φ.</p>
<p>Such an axiomatization resolves the need for deductive apparatus for A. More importantly it allows formalization of the idea that the class of ordinals, Ord, behaves like a large cardinal: One replaces "V<sub>κ</sub> satisfying ZFC" with "V<sub>κ</sub> such that κ has such and such large cardinal properties". Such formalization extends the strength of the large cardinal to the highest available level of expression. Removing "ZFC proves that" from the formalization would increase the strength but also require greater ontological commitment.</p>
<p>The weaker formalization with a mild strengthening of the large cardinal implies the unstrengthened stronger one. For the extensions above, it suffices to replace large cardinal with regular limit of stationary many of these large cardinals. For example, ZFC proves that for every Mahlo cardinal κ, V<sub>κ</sub>satisfies "there is Σ<sub>n</sub>correct inaccessible cardinal" for every natural number n.</p>

<h3>A General Extension</h3>
<p>The general idea behind the almost self-referential extensions is that restricted self-reference is meaningful when there is a guarantee that there are no contradictions and ambiguities. That idea can be formalized in a general way. Fix a Gödel numbering {φ<sub>0</sub>, φ<sub>1</sub>, φ<sub>2</sub> ...}of sentences of set theory with a predicate S. For this definition, let us call n is good iff n is a natural number and for every ordinal κ there is a unique set S such that (V<sub>κ</sub>, ∈, S) satisfies φ<sub>n</sub>. Let P<sub>n</sub> be empty if n is not good and otherwise be such that φ<sub>n</sub> is true where S is P<sub>n</sub>. Define P so that ∀n∀x (P(n, x)↔P<sub>n</sub>(x)). By reflection, the uniqueness of S for all sufficiently well-behaved models implies uniqueness of P<sub>n</sub>, so P is unique. The expressiveness of the extension can be altered by changing the conditions on "good", but any reasonable form (including this one) is more expressive than the extensions above but less expressive than Σ<sup>V</sup> formulas of second order logic about V.</p>

<h2><a id="A5">Proper Classes</h2>
<p>For many basic properties, such as the property of having one element, there is no set of all objects satisfying the property. To deal with such properties, the notion of proper class was invented.</p>
<p>A proper class would be a collection of objects that is too large to be a set. The problem is that a set is any collection of objects. The cumulative hierarchy is without end, so if proper classes did exist, we could form a layer on top of them (and obtain a hyper-class of all classes of ordinals), and after adding sufficiently many layers, discover that the previous notion of set was too restrictive and that what was considered to be proper classes are actually sets.</p>
<p>Note: Most set theorists accept the argument and thus reject the naive treatment of proper classes as collections. However, if one believes in proper classes, then one can use almost self-referential logic to make (what one would believe are) more expressive statements about proper classes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the word "proper class" is frequently used in set theory and category theory, so some treatment is needed. There are three alternatives.</p>
<ul><li>One can treat proper classes as syntactical objects and sets as sets and work in a theory conservative over set theory. For example, NBG (which includes global choice) is conservative over ZFC. However, one can do much better using strong reflection principles: Ord would be a large cardinal; the classes would satisfy full comprehension, and one can even build hyper-classes and higher types with appropriate comprehension.</li>
<li>One can consider only sets whose rank is smaller than a certain ordinal κ, and treat collections of these sets as classes. The ordinal should be sufficiently large to include all objects under consideration, and V<sub>κ</sub> should satisfy enough correctness so that relevant statements, if true in V<sub>κ</sub>, are true in V. Strong reflection principles allow one to assume that V<sub>κ</sub>is sufficiently closed (at the least, κ should be inaccessible, but weak compactness, total indescribability, and more are desirable). Almost self-referential logic (with the corresponding enhancement of replacement) allows selection of κ with unprecedented degree of correctness: V<sub>κ</sub> could be an elementary substructure of V and some second order statements about V<sub>κ</sub>transfer (in a truth preserving way) into almost self-referential statements about V.</li>
<li>One can treat classes semantically as descriptions, and for a set x and proper class X, treat x ∈ X as "set x satisfies description X". Almost self-referential logic allows much richer descriptions, and hence much stronger closure properties. For example, if the descriptions are formulas in infinitary logic, then a union/disjunction of (set size many) proper classes is a proper class.</li></ul>
<p>Particular proper classes are best treated as properties or descriptions. Almost self-referential logic ensures meaningfulness of recursive definitions along well-founded relations, which makes working with proper classes easier. The extensions presented, however, are too weak for proper treatment of quantification over the totality of classes, and thus do not fully satisfy current epistemological needs.</p>
