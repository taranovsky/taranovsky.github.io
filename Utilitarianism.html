<h1 align="center">Utilitarianism</h1>
<P>
	The most important question of all is what should one do since the
ultimate purpose of answering questions is either to satisfy
curiosity or to decide which action to take.  Complicated analysis is
often required to answer that question.  Beyond ordinary analysis,
one must also have a system of values, and the correct system of
values is utilitarianism.</P>
<P>
	Utilitarianism is the system of values stating that maximizing the
total happiness of all people is good.  Happiness of people should be
sacrificed only to bring greater happiness to other people. 
Psychologically, immediate happiness corresponds to what you want. 
Pain, including psychological distress, is the opposite of happiness.
 Actual happiness is not the same as apparent happiness:  A person
experiencing strong physical pleasure may suffer hidden psychological
distress;  the inner desire of martyrs to do what is right can
override obvious physical pain.  People do not always do what they
want because sacrificing immediate happiness is often best to achieve
long-term happiness of themselves and others.  Utilitarianism per se
does not answer the question of how many people should be created. 
However, creating too many people will damage the environment and
thus impair the long term ability to have large population on Earth. 
Moreover,  it is generally agreed that if the society can allow all
people to be prosperous and thriving and that creating extra people
will undermine that ability, then extra people should not be created.</P>
<P>
	If you know with certainty what will maximize happiness, you should
do that.  The problem, of course, is that you (almost) never know the
future with certainty.  The question of what should one do is a
question of how to make decisions.  Information that you cannot
access cannot impact your decision making and thus does not affect
what you should do:  Decisions to play a lottery should be based on
the odds (which are usually not in your favor) and not on whether,
unknowingly to you, your number happens to be a winning one.  Thus, a
choice of values is a choice of the decision making procedure.</P>
<P>
	As with every other general theory, a naive interpretation of
utilitarianism may lead to incorrect results.    For example, one may
be tempted to steal to transfer money to a more deserving person. 
However, our economic system can work only if property rights are
protected, so the government has a duty to prevent theft.  Theft has
dangers and negative side effects such as punishment of the thief,
distress of the owner, and abridgments of property rights, which are
necessary for good economy.  Thieves tend to have an inflated opinion
of themselves; a decision procedure for theft must account for such
inflation.  It is for these reasons that theft is generally wrong,
and for the same reasons, most societies developed an intuitive
disapproval of theft.  In another example, a judge may be tempted to
misinterpret an unjust law so as to reach the desired result. 
However, the power of the judiciary is based on their good faith
interpretations of the laws.  Judicial honesty is essential for the
retainment of such power and thus for the compelling benefits of an
independent judiciary.  Another misinterpretation of utilitarianism
is that you have to give away all your money to poor people in third
world countries.  However, money can be successfully invested,
producing more money and thus ability to do greater good.  College
education, while costly, greatly improves the ability to earn money
and thus allows greater contribution to the poor.  Moderate comfort,
rest, and entertainment improve productivity.  Also, idealism can
fail; one's determination to do good today does not guarantee doing
good tomorrow.  Incentives are needed to sustain the determination;
rewarding oneself for hard work causes one to work hard and thus do
more good.</P>
<P>
An objection to utilitarianism is the claim that the ultimate goal of
utilitarianism can be achieved through a pleasure machine:  Every
person&rsquo;s brain is connected to the machine, which sends signals
to produce extreme pleasure, while suppressing all feelings but
pleasure.  However, feelings are meaningless but in the context of
understanding.  One can assign a high pleasure number to a stone, but
the pleasure number is meaningless because the stone cannot
understand or contemplate pleasure or anything else.  Similarly,
happiness can only exist in the presence of intellectual processing
and struggle that gives it meaning, and our intuition that such
pleasure machine would destroy everything we value is compatible with
utilitarianism.</P>
<P>
Some people argue that utilitarianism is contrary to human rights. 
The support for human rights is based on our feelings and deep
beliefs that human rights are good.  These feelings do not arise in a
vacuum.   They are acquired because, as history repeatedly shows,
violations of human rights have horrible consequences.  Censorship,
more likely than not, prevents indispensible changes in societies
that practice it.  The benefits of torture are insignificant compared
to the suffering it inflicts and the damage to benevolence of the
society.   Because of fallibility of human nature and the special
nature of fundamental rights, abridgements of human rights cause
unacceptable danger to the society.   For example, allowing the
government to conduct a lottery for forcible organ donations would
present unacceptable danger for abuse as the government can kill any
person by faking the lottery results.  It is such abuses in the past,
senseless government sponsored murders for alleged public good that
cause a subconscious aversion to such lottery.  Thus, the utilitarian
benefits of human rights coincide with the main reasons why the
feelings on human rights have developed.  Unlike reliance on
feelings, utilitarianism places human rights on a strong logical
foundation.   The intuitions for human rights are fragile, and many
societies lack them; even in the United States today, government
sponsored homicide of certain helpless &quot;undesirable&quot;
people, i.e. death penalty, is considered acceptable.  Moreover,
wrong intuitions can create fictitious rights, like the right of
parents to beat their children, or, in the past, the right of slave
owners to their lawfully acquired property, slaves.   Therefore,
utilitarianism protects and enhances human rights.</P>
<P>
	The most significant alleged problem of utilitarianism is its
rejection of the conventional view of justice:  According to
utilitarianism, taken per se, the well-being of a murderer is as
important as the well-being of the President of the United States. 
However, the two should not be treated equally:  Murderers may be
dangerous and so should be confined; it is essential to discourage
murder; the position of the President should attract competent
candidates, and the well-being of the President is very important for
the nation.</P>
<P>
In most cases, relatives of a murder victim have a burning feeling,
which is partially shared by the society, that the murderer must be
punished, that justice demands punishment. That feeling usually comes
without justification by the relatives of the victim.  Instead, it is
a protective feeling.  Punishment can be very effective in preventing
future harm.  From evolutionary point of view, the desire to punish
for harm is caused by the need to protect from harm.  Retribution,
which often comes under the name of justice, is highly valued in most
cultures because by deterring harm it can be highly beneficial, yet
the connection between punishment and protection is sufficiently
subtle for many people to view retribution is an end in itself rather
than as a means to achieve good. 
</P>
<P>
The cases of human rights and justice are illustrative of a general
relationship between traditional views and utilitarian ones: 
Utilitarians look at the reasons that conventional rules of conduct
are correct whereas traditionalists take traditional moral values
(which are often intuitively true because they have been taught and
reinforced by the society since childhood) as correct per se. 
Conventional moral views do not appear out of nowhere; they appear by
evolution and natural selection.  The innate, that is genetic,
dispositions for views on what is right and wrong are based on what
is most likely to cause survival and reproduction in a Stone Age
society.  It is because of the survival and reproduction value that
most people value themselves above all, that high priority is placed
on the family, that incest is disapproved, and that retribution is
treated as a moral prerogative.  Cultures also evolve through natural
selection.  Cultures with superior (in a certain way) moral values
are likely to spread and become dominant because their values cause
the people to make choices that are better (in a certain way) than
choices made by people of other cultures.  Finally, inside a
particular culture, morals evolve by natural selection.  Moral views
that are beneficial (under the relevant metric) become slowly
accepted, while harmful moral views are slowly rejected.  The
inability of natural selection of ethical views to keep pace with
societal and technological changes that alter which conduct is most
beneficial is one of the major causes of the disagreement of
traditional views with utilitarianism; the other is that the
selection is for benefit of the individuals and groups, hence
traditional views deemphasize helping outsiders but elevate
patriotism toward the relevant groups.</P>
<P>
The main argument for utilitarianism is that happiness
is good and that there is no reason for one person's happiness to be
more important than anothers and that there is no reason to follow a
rule of conduct that is known to be detrimental to the happiness of
us all.  Ordinary rules of logic (such as modus ponens) do not allow
the inference that something should be done without an ethical value
as a premise, and hence alone cannot be used to derive basic values. 
Instead, potential reasons for and against utilitarianism are
minimization of unexplainable&mdash;the principle that gives
validity to the scientific method.  A theory of
morality that deviates from utilitarianism would leave unexplained
the extent that one person's happiness is more important than
another's and the level of importance of non-happiness related
elements.  In a non-utilitarian theory of morality, the precise
importance assigned to each of the values is inherently arbitrary,
hence utilitarianism is the only non-arbitrary theory of morality. 
For example, a theory of morality may consider prohibition of theft
and protection of human life as basic values, with protection of
human life being more important if and only if the amount stolen to
save the life is less than $1234.56, the exact amount being purely
arbitrary.</P>
<P>
Thus, minimization of unexplainable compels
utilitarianism unless disagreement of traditional beliefs with the
correct theory of morality is unexplainable and hence a reason to
reject utilitarianism.  However, an explanation of traditional moral
beliefs is presented above, so the disagreement is fully explainable.
 Even if the disagreement did not appear explainable, it would not
constitute a reason to reject utilitarianism because different
cultures and subcultures have contradictory moral views.  A society
may consider an action to be an obvious wrong while another society
considers that action morally obligatory.  For example, while some
societies view cannibalism as  disrespectful of the body of the dead
and as such clearly wrong, in other societies humans eat flesh of
deceased relatives to help ensure the continuation of the spirit of
the deceased.  Given a non-utilitarian belief, even one that the
society holds sacred, it is at least possible that another society
(possibly on a different planet) holds precisely the opposite belief
just as sacred, the only universal being that people try to do
what they want unless they perceive a reason to do otherwise.  If you
feel that your unexplainable moral values are true because of divine
guidance, then another person probably feels that his unexplainable
moral beliefs (contradictory to yours) are also true as they are
caused by divine guidance:  Examples of contradictory claims of
divine guidance abound.  The only way to resolve the disagreement is
by reasoning about basic moral values independently of the fact that
your culture has such and such moral beliefs&mdash;and such reasoning
leads to utilitarianism.</P>
<P>
Many traditions and values of the American society are beneficial,
but some are harmful.  Acceptance of utilitarianism will preserve
beneficial traditions while replacing the harmful ones.  As a result,
new traditions, grounded in reason, will emerge, and future
generations may wonder how the irrational and unnatural
non-utilitarian values had survived for so long.</P>
