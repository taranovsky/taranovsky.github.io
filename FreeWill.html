<h1 align="center">Existence of Free Will</h1>
<p></p>
<p> Existence
of free will is often argued from introspection. Freedom means
choice. Since I chose to write this paper and I could have chosen
otherwise, I am free in writing this paper. However, to establish
that I could have chosen otherwise, proving that I felt that I could
have chosen otherwise is not enough: One must also prove that my
choice is the original cause of my motives to write this paper.</p>
<p> According
to compatibilists, your action is free if the immediate cause of the
action are your thoughts, there is no coercion, no duress (physical
or mental), and your thoughts satisfy a certain condition on freedom,
which varies depending on the compatibilist. If that is used as
definition of freedom, then my writing this paper is free.</p>
<p> Unfortunately,
if determinism is true, then the compatibilist freedom is merely an
illusion of freedom. In evaluating freedom, we are not interested in
counter factual conditionals unless the agent was free to make the
conditional true. If a person is being shot, then the person would
have been unharmed if he had stopped the bullet. Nevertheless, the
person is not free not to be harmed because he was not free to stop
the bullet.</p>
<p> According
to determinism, my actions today are determined by what had existed a
million years ago. Thus, if what happened a million years ago is
held fixed, it is (according to determinism) impossible for me not to
write this paper. I could only choose not to write this paper by
changing what occurred one million years ago, and that is impossible.
One can argue that there are some possible worlds in which the past
is different and I am not writing this paper. However, we are
restricted to this world, freedom of choice means freedom to choose
in <i>this</i> world, where the past is unalterable. Existence of
possible worlds in which what happened one million years ago was
different is irrelevant. Moreover, the only way to show existence
of possibilities is through choices and randomness, so if the world
is deterministic, there is no evidence that the world can possibly be
anything but what it is; deciding what is possible would be a matter
of convention and not reality. In a deterministic world, choosing to
do otherwise is as impossible as choosing for 2+2 to equal five: Under
no circumstance does any person has any choice.</p>
<p> Rejection
of determinism, however, is insufficient for free will. Mere
randomness does not amount to freedom since it is indistinguishable
whether the randomness is generated now or one million years ago.
Postulating a free agent is not sufficient either, because of the
following argument: Suppose that whenever you act, you act a
particular way solely because of the way you are except for the
external factors or randomness. At this moment, you cannot change
what you are at this moment since at any given time you are what you
are at that time. The external factors are also what they are--they
can change with time, but we are analyzing them at the time you make
the choice. If an outcome is random, you cannot choose it either. If
you had chosen to act otherwise, then since your choice is based
solely on yourself, external factors, and randomness, these factors
would be different from what they are. Since you cannot change these
factors, you cannot choose to act otherwise. For a choice to be
genuine, both outcomes must be possible for this actual world instead
of just in other possible worlds in which you, external factors, or
random results are different. Both outcomes must be possible in the
set of worlds where the factors you cannot control (such as whether
you have wings) are what they are in this world. Otherwise, the
alternate choice would mean that you can choose and control the
factors you cannot control. Since choosing differently is
contradictory, you do not have choice.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p> Instead,
your (free) choice must be the original cause of your action. The
fact that your choice is not caused in an ordinary way does not mean
that it is random: The universe as a whole could not have been
caused by something; it exists (just like you choices) in an out of
itself. If God exists, then the original cause for much of the
universe is the will of God, and the original cause for the rest are
the free choices of men. </p>
<p> You
consider many aspects of your choice, such as the most probable
consequences, and the dangers and rewards for you and the society.
External factors affect your consideration. Sometimes you proceed
randomly. But in the end you are the one to choose, being the
supernatural being that you are. The concept of choice is
fundamental, so it is not subject to explanation or understanding in
terms of the more basic concepts. You can choose according to your
dispositions and random factors or you can choose against them; it is
up to you. You are the person you choose to be.</p>
<p> Now that
the meaning of free will is clear, it remains to prove that sometimes
people make choices. By definition, if you have choice, you can act
one way and you can act differently. It is universally agreed that
sometimes I should do something or should not do something. Word
'should' has meaning only in the context of choice: If it is
impossible for you to choose to fly, then the claim that you should
fly to save yourself is either meaningless or false. If terrorists
cannot choose not to kill people, then the claim that they should not
kill is as false as the claim that they should undo the deaths of the
people they killed. There would be nothing wrong with terrorism just
like there is nothing wrong with priests not bringing dead people
into life. If free will does not exist, then nothing is wrong.</p>
<p> Since
terrorism is wrong, free will exists. I am sure that victims of
terrorist attacks will agree that terrorism is wrong. A philosopher
(unless he is a victim) might resist, claiming that determinism or
absence of free will is logically true and that we should not judge
terrorism to be wrong since such a judgment is logically incoherent.
However, if free will does not exist, then the claim that we should
think logically is false, so his argument would be unpersuasive--the
philosopher cannot claim that we should accept the transitive the
rule of logic without contradicting his conclusion (nonexistence of
free will is incompatible with word 'should'). The philosopher
cannot argue that something is wrong with argument "2+2=5, so
free will exists" since if free will did not exist, there would
be nothing wrong with that argument, for there would be no reason to
prefer propositional logic over the logic used in the argument. A
reason to prefer propositional logic would imply choice between
different claims, and such choice is impossible without free will.
Preference of knowledge over ignorance is meaningful only in the
context of propositional logic and choice. </p>
<p> Thus, free
will along with propositional logic form the basis of human
knowledge. If some statement contradicts to free will, that would be
a problem of that statement and not of free will. Much of our common
sense is contradictory. Paradoxes are solved by removing false
common-sense assumptions. One paradox is that of logical
determinism: Since we cannot change the future, we cannot choose
anything but the future, so we cannot make choices. However, if free
will is impossible unless there is P such that "P will happen
tomorrow, but it was false yesterday that P will happen tomorrow,"
then such P exists and we can change the future. If free will means
that until we make a choice, both possibilities are equally real and
neither is the actual future, then so be it.<br>
</p>
<p> Since free
will requires that to some extent some intelligent and responsible
free choices are made ex nihilo (out of nothing), this is what
happens. If this contradicts our basic beliefs on causation, then our
beliefs are wrong and should be modified: Free will
is on par with propositional logic, which supersedes all other beliefs.
Of
course, to a large extent human choices are based on prior events,
which is why training and advising people is so valuable. Forethought
is crucial both because it influences choices and because
choices occur disguised in thought. Human thought is very rich, and
choices are hidden in the complexity and drama of thought.</p>
<p> A skeptic
might argue either that we know nothing or that all that we think we
know is wrong. However, word 'know' is a very useful one, and
attempts at defining it are convoluted. If a skeptic logically
concludes that we know nothing, then the word 'know' was defined too
narrowly and should be redefined to fit with its common use. We
cannot supply ordinary justification to everything, since
something, (such as certain aspects of logic) cannot be justified
without invoking circular arguments. Instead, human beings must
choose what to believe and propositional logic along with free will
is the only practical choice since it is the only choice that allows
practical decision making. Accordingly, we have no practical choice
but to believe the basis of knowledge; we have no choice but to
accept it as true and dismiss the skeptical complaints, for any
meaningful discussion of the complaints would be based on what we
accept as the basis of knowledge.</p>
<p> Arguments
against free will are valuable in that they force us to reconsider
some of the basic assumptions that we make. However, they are
ultimately unpersuasive since, in the end, human ability to make
choices is the basis of knowledge. Some philosophers sincerely claim
that free will does not exist, but their views are contradictory, for
as human beings they believe in freedom.</p>
