<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center">Mandatory Treatment of Alcohol
Addicts</h1>
<p>Many people are alcoholics: They drink alcohol excessively and cannot stop
their drinking.&nbsp; Although treatment is beneficial, most alcoholics refuse
it.&nbsp; To protect people, laws should be passed to allow forced treatment of
alcoholics.</p>
<p>Alcoholism is a mental illness in which the victim needs alcohol for normal
mental operation.&nbsp; About 10% of the United States population are addicted
to alcohol.&nbsp; Alcoholism is caused by chemical imbalance in the brain from
repeated excessive alcohol consumption. &nbsp;Alcoholism essentially forces the
victim to consume alcohol and aggravate the disease.&nbsp; The disease is often
fatal due to serious destruction done by alcohol, which acts as a poison.&nbsp;
For example, alcohol can cause liver cirrhosis, that is replacement of liver
cells by scar tissue often causing the liver to become non-functional and the
victim to die.&nbsp; Damage from alcohol in the USA is on the rise and was $185
billion in 1998 according to NIH.</p>
<p>Treatment of alcoholism is clearly beneficial for the patients and the
society.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the treatment often does not work since the
patient is psychologically unable to stop alcohol consumption.&nbsp; Most
alcoholics refuse (or choose not to have) treatment. They deny their alcohol
consumption.&nbsp; When the denial becomes impossible, the disease has already
caused too much damage and may be too advanced for voluntary treatment to
succeed.</p>
<p>If, however, alcoholics could be forced to undergo treatment, the success
rate can be close to 100%.&nbsp; At least, the person can be &quot;locked
up&quot; during the withdrawal period and be required not to drink alcohol
afterward and to undergo periodical checks to ensure that he or she does not
resume drinking.&nbsp; The treatment can be made more pleasant and the subject
more cooperative through good treatment conditions and an alcohol awareness
program.&nbsp; Of course, in many cases the treatment should be less dramatic
than &quot;locking up&quot; the patient. Thus, mandatory treatment can solve or
greatly reduce the problem of alcoholism.</p>
<p>The treatment does not violate patient rights.&nbsp; Authorization should be
given only by a court, thus ensuring due process of law.&nbsp; The patient does
not have a right to refuse the treatment since his/her acts are due to the
mental illness (addiction to alcohol) and the acts are physically
self-destructive.&nbsp; Similarly, since some children are likely to do bad acts
due to their incompetence, parents or guardians are allowed much control over
the children.</p>
<p>If adopted, forced treatment for alcoholism would save countless people from
the slow deterioration ending in death.&nbsp; Unlike laws barring selling and/or
consumption of alcohol, the treatment applies only to people who severely suffer
from alcohol. Besides, forcing treatment in only some cases does not bring the
chaos of enforcing laws in only some cases.&nbsp; Forced treatment of alcohol
addicts should be allowed and encouraged.</p>
