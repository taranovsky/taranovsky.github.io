<h1 align="center" style="text-align: center;">Language</h1>
<p>Universal language is a system of communication in which everything
that is comprehensible can be communicated.&nbsp; Language consists of
statements, which give information; queries, which request information;
and commands, which specify what to do.&nbsp; A sentence is any
statement, query, or command.&nbsp; Objects (both real and imaginary)
are represented by words. A generic object is a collection (set) of
objects.</p>
<p>A statement consists of an object (subject) and the properties
stated about the object (predicate).&nbsp; A statement can also consist
of logical (using 'and', 'or', or 'not' as linkers called conjunctions<a
 name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>) composition of
statements.&nbsp; A statement can also include justification.&nbsp; A
special type of statement is definition, which consists of a name and a
specification of the objects (including actions) to which the name
refers.&nbsp; The specification can be a union of (usually generic)
objects, a complement of an object (anything that is not the object),
and thus the intersection of objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A property specifies a collection of objects having it.&nbsp; Thus,
properties are equivalent to generic objects.&nbsp; A predicate often
consists of the property type (verb) and its value (object).&nbsp;
Thus, in "cat has fur", the object described is cat, the property
claimed about the cat is "has fur"; the property is presented as type
(what items does the cat have) and value (fur).<br>
</p>
<p>Justification of statement X can consist of several statements from
which X is derived through stated logical manipulation.&nbsp; For
example, statements 'if A then <span style="font-family: Symbol;"></span>B'
and 'A' together lead to statement 'B'.&nbsp; Justification can occur
through application of properties:&nbsp; 'A is B' when applied to 'B is
C' leads to 'A is C'.&nbsp; The validity of such application refers to
transitive property of properties.</p>
<p>A predicate can include a description of probability that the
property applies.&nbsp; When the subject is a generic object, the
predicate includes how the property applies to the object:
&nbsp;whether it applies to all objects, most objects, some objects,
etc.<br>
</p>
<p>A query (often called 'question') consists of an object (subject)
and the type of information wanted (predicate), of a statement to be
evaluated as true or false, or of a statement with a request for its
justification.&nbsp; A function is something that when attached to an
object, produces an object.&nbsp; (For example, in "the color of the
tomato is red", 'color' is function applied to 'the tomato' and has
value 'red'.)&nbsp; Queries can be viewed as requests to evaluate a
function.&nbsp; Functions are objects and are taken from experiences,
actions, or defined from other functions.</p>
<p>A command consists of an object asked to complete the command
(subject) and the action to complete (predicate).&nbsp; Commands can be
conditional:&nbsp; A conditional command is a statement with an action
to do if the statement is true and action to do if the statement is
false.</p>
<p>A statement may state the importance of a sentence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basic objects (including actions) are taken from sensory input
and output.</p>

<p><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a>Other conjunctions
can be used; however 'or' and 'not' are sufficient.&nbsp; For example,
'if A then B' means 'not A or B'.</p>
