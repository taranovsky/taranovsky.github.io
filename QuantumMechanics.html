<h1 align="center">Quantum Mechanics</h1>
<p>In quantum mechanics, each system is in a superposition of its basis
states. For example, particles assume a superposition of all positions <b>r</b>
and (using a different basis) a superposition of momenta <b>p</b>. The
principle of superposition applies, so time evolution is linear. A
vector is a superposition of the basis vectors, so quantum systems are
represented by vectors. The quantum state of the universe can be
approximated to the desired precision by a vector in a
finite-dimensional vector space and can be stated exactly either as a
sequence of such vectors by using increasingly detailed approximations
or as a vector in an infinite dimensional Euclidean space.<br>
Note: h-bar has been omitted from the equations in accordance with <a
 href="Foundations.html">Foundations of Physics</a>.</p>
<p>Each system is represented by a vector (with complex-valued
components) normalized to one. Observation is represented by a
Hermitian (O<sub>ab</sub>=O<sub>ba</sub>*) matrix/operator O. As a
result of observation, the vector becomes one of the orthonormal
eigenvectors of O. ("a" is normalized to 1 means &lt;a, a&gt;=1. A set
of vectors is called orthonormal when every vector is normalized to 1
and for every 2 different vectors their inner product is 0.) The
observation gives an eigenvalue (&#955;) corresponding to the eigenvector.
The amplitude of the transfer from p to q, &#968; =&lt;q|p&gt; = &lt;p,
q&gt; = sum of p<sub>j</sub>q<sub>j</sub><sup>c</sup> for all <i>j</i>
such that p<sub>j</sub>and q<sub>j</sub> are components of p and q. (for
real <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, (a+b<i>i</i>)<sup>c</sup>= (a-b<i>i</i>); <i>i<sup>2</sup></i>=-1).
(For functions, &lt;p, q&gt;= integral of p(r)q(r)<sup>c</sup> over the
domain, where r is the argument of the functions.) The probability of
the transfer to a given eigenvector, P, is |&#968;|<sup>2</sup>. The
expectation value is S(P<sub>i</sub>&#955;<sub>i</sub>) where the summation
is over all eigenvectors and can be shown to equal &lt;p|Op&gt; for
state p. According to the principle of superposition, observation
should yield a superposition of results, not a single result. Thus,
quantum mechanics cannot apply completely to the observer. (Quantum
mechanics can, however, be applied to an "observer" that cannot feel by
stating that an observation leads to an entanglement (relation) between
the observer and the system observed.)</p>
<p>Time dependence of systems is described by the linear differential
equation: <b><i>i</i>*&#966;&#8242;(t)=H&#966; </b>where &#966;(t) is the state at time t
and H, called Hamiltonian, is a Hermitian matrix/operator. (<i>i<sup>2</sup></i>=-1).
Therefore, &#966;(t)=e<sup>-iHt</sup>&#966;(0). Hamiltonian is an observable--it
is energy.</p>
<p><b>Theorem:</b> Quantity represented by O is conserved if and only if
physical laws are invariant under the operator e<sup>i&#955;O</sup> for every
real &#955;.<br>
<b>Corollary:</b><span style=""> Setting O=H, invariance of physical
laws in time (since e<sup>-iHt</sup> is time translation) shows
conservation of energy.</span><br>
<b>Note: </b>Conserved quantities have the same eigenvectors as
Hamiltonian (H) and thus commute with H.<br>
<b>Specific Example:</b> If a system is isolated, H does not depend on
time since d&#966;/dt depends only on &#966; and physical laws, and physical laws
are invariant of time. If H is invariant of time, and if a state (&#966;<sub>i</sub>)
is an eigenvector of H, the time dependence can be shown to be e<sup>-iEt</sup>&#966;<sub>i</sub>
where E is energy of the system, which is the corresponding eigenvalue.
Since the probability distribution of &#966;<sub>i</sub> does not change in
time, it is called a stationary state. Since Hermitian matrices have a
full set of orthonormal eigenvectors, every system is a superposition
of stationary states with coefficients of time independent magnitude.
Thus, (and since energy of stationary states is time independent)
energy is conserved.</p>
<p>Sometimes, certain quantum states need not be distinguished. In that
case, the basis states are arranged in several collections, such that
states in a collection are not distinguished but the collections
themselves are distinguished. The collections can then be considered as
basis states. (The amplitude for a collection is the sum of the
amplitudes for the basis states of the collection.) An observation can
be partial, that is treating collections as basis states. A partial
observation does not affect the relative value of states in a
collection.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics provides the framework for individual theories. A
quantum theory is created by stating information about the Hamiltonian
and relating the basis states to human observations.</p>
<p>We now build the quantum theory for non-relativistic particles. A
finite collection of particles is given. Each particle has a type (such
as electron or proton). Each type is either fermion or boson. Each
state is a doubly differentiable superposition of the following states (<b>r</b>):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 56.9pt;">Each particle has a position (an
ordered triple of coordinates) and a spin (either true or false).
(Thus, a state for a system of <i>n</i> particles has 3<i>n</i> real
valued components and <i>n</i> Boolean components.) We are given the
total potential energy of the system (U) as a function of the state (<b>r</b>).</p>
<p>The quantum state is subject to the following restriction: An
interchange of any two fermion particles of the same type multiples the
state by -1. An interchange of boson particles of the same type does
not change the state. (According to quantum mechanics, particles of the
same type are identical and their interchange cannot be observed.)</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian H is the sum of the kinetic and potential part. The
potential part is the operator U, that is (U&#966;)(<b>r</b>)=U(<b>r</b>)&#966;(<b>r</b>).
Let <b>&#966;</b>(i, j) be the distribution of coordinate <i>j</i> (one of
the 3 spatial coordinates) of particle <i>i</i>. It is computed by <b>&#966;</b>(i,
j)(<i>x</i>)=the appropriate integral of &#966;(<b>r</b>) over the region
where the coordinate <i>j</i> of particle <i>i</i> is equal to <i>x</i>.
(Theorem:<span style=""> </span><b>&#966;</b>(i, j) is normalized.)<span
 style="">  </span>The kinetic part is the sum of K(i, j) (kinetic
energy operator) for all particles <i>i</i> and coordinates <i>j</i>,
where K(i, j)(<b>r</b>)=-(&#8706;<sup>2</sup><b>&#966;</b>(i, j)(<i>x</i>) /&#8706;<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>)/2<i>m<sub>i</sub></i>
where <i>x</i> is the coordinate j of particle i and <i>m<sub>i</sub></i>
is mass of particle i.<span style=""> </span>The basic theory is now
stated and can be specified further.</p>
<p>Thus, for a single non-relativistic particle of mass <i>m</i>, H=<b>p</b><sup>2</sup>/2<i>m</i>+U,
where U(<b>r</b>) is potential energy at <b>r</b>, and momentum, <b>p</b>=-i(&#8706;/&#8706;x+&#8706;/&#8706;y+&#8706;/&#8706;z).
(For a free non-relativistic particle with energy E and momentum <b>p, </b>the
wavefunction is &#966;(<b>r</b>,t) = C*e<sup>-i(Et-<b>p·r</b>)</sup>.)</p>
<p>Two fermions of the same type cannot assume the same quantum state
(the superposition of the 3 coordinates and the spin) because then
their exchange would not affect the system and thus will not multiply
the state by -1. It can be proved that because spin is a superposition
of two values, at most two fermions of the same type can assume the
same superposition of coordinates. Other fermions may have to assume
states of higher energy.</p>
<p>Energy is quickly observed. Thus, systems tend to assume states of
definitive energy. In reality (but not in this theory), systems can
emit and absorb photons (light) and change between states of different
energy. The energy of the photon can be found from the conservation of
energy. Spontaneously, systems eventually emit photon(s), if such
emission is possible. The emission and absorption cannot be properly
described here because photons move with a relativistic speed <i>c</i>.
However, non-relativistic approximations for the transition rates exist.</p>
<p>The theory above is further specified by stating the particle types
and the potential energy. The following specification correctly
predicts large parts of chemistry. Each particle has a mass (<i>m<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>m<sub>i</sub>&gt;0</i>)
and electric charge (a real number <i>q<sub>i</sub></i>). The
potential energy is the sum of potential energies (U<sub>{i, j}</sub>)
for all <i>unordered</i> pairs {<i>i, j</i>} of particles ({<i>i, i</i>}
is not counted). U<sub>{i, j}</sub>=kq<sub>i</sub>q<sub>j</sub>/d(i,
j)-G<i>m<sub>i</sub>m<sub>j</sub></i>/d(i, j) where <i>d</i> is
distance between its arguments, k is the Coulomb's constant and G is
the gravitational constant. (The second term is very small and can
usually be ignored.) The particles are electrons and nuclei of atoms.
Electron is a fermion and has electric charge of -1. Nuclei are
classified by proton number (<i>p</i>) and neutron number (<i>n</i>).<i>p</i>
and <i>n</i> are nonnegative integers; <i>n+p</i>&gt;0. Charge of
nucleus is <i>p</i>. Mass is roughly proportional to <i>n+p</i>;
tables of nuclides have more precise masses; mass of a proton (<i>p</i>=1,<i>n</i>=0)
is approximately 1.67*10<sup>-27</sup>kg; mass of an electron is about
9.11*10<sup>-31</sup>kg. A nucleus is a fermion if and only if n+p is
odd.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, calculations are often difficult, so elaborate
approximation techniques are used. For example, many systems are
numerically analyzed as a small perturbation (deviation) from systems
for which the time dependence was solved. Generalized functions are
used as idealization of particular conditions (a sharp change in the
potential is idealized as an instantaneous change). In non-relativistic
mechanics, the stationary states are non-normalizable: The wavefunction
density must be the same everywhere in space and hence cannot be
normalized to one. Instead, the system is typically represented by the
coordinates of the center of mass and the coordinates of all particles
but one relative to the center of mass. The time evolution (dependence)
of the system is then separated into time dependence of the center of
mass (which can be easily computed since momentum is conserved) and the
evolution of the coordinates relative to the center of mass of all
particles but one. The later is usually normalizable, and the equations
of motion can be derived from the theory.</p>
