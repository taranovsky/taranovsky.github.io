<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 15pt">New Axioms for
Set Theory</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Note:</B> This paper is a condensed draft.</FONT></P>
<P>The base theory is ZFC.</P>
<P>Add predicate Tr for infinitary statements such that Tr(S) &harr;
S is a set that codes a true infinitary statement.</P>
<P><B>Axiom schema:</B> If ZFC proves that for all measurable
cardinals &kappa;, &phi; holds in the structure (V(&kappa;),
membership, Tr), then  &phi;.</P>
<P><B>Justification: </B>Take a mental image of the universe. Various
theorems strongly suggest that such images can be made with arbitrary
accuracy. Try extending it with new cardinals. There must be some
reason why the new cardinals are not realized in the universe. A good
reason is non-rigidity, that is the existence of a nontrivial
elementary embedding of V into M if the cardinals existed: Such
embedding raises the question as to why the universe is V rather than
M; metaphorically speaking, such embedding implies that V is not held
together by its structure. (Still, there is a substantial likelihood
that measurable cardinals do exist in the universe.) Detailed studies
have shown that no breakdown of structure occurs at lower cardinal
levels, and that the hierarchy of cardinals below measurable is
canonical. The theory of sets is canonical and the axiom schema
appears to be simply a canonical schema stating that the universe is
endless and that an extension would be nonrigid, and providing
powerful reflection principles for set theory. Also, the axiom schema
with measurable replaced by inaccessible can be approximated by
allowing greater expressiveness in the formulas in the replacement
axiom schema and be viewed as the natural limit of such
approximations.</P>
<P>Generalized Continuum Hypothesis: For every infinite cardinal &kappa;,
2<SUP>&kappa;</SUP> = &kappa;<SUP>+</SUP>.</P>
<P><B>Justification:</B> The hypothesis holds in all canonical inner
models in fact, a J-structure is considered acceptable only if it
satisfies GCH. It can be easily forced by collapsing cardinals; in
fact, ground models for forcing usually satisfy GCH. GCH is a natural
strengthening of the Axiom of Choice: GCH implies the Axiom of Choice
over ZF and the &ldquo;unintuitive&rdquo; consequences of GCH can be
viewed as the natural strengthening of the consequences of the axiom
of choice. For example, the axiom of choice produces a well-ordering
of real numbers, while the GCH produces a well-ordering of real
numbers with each member having only countably many predecessors. GCH
is the <B>only</B> canonical theory of cardinal arithmetic. The
theory of the generalized Cantor spaces is much more natural with the
GCH. It is possible in models of ZFC to cause &omega;<SUB>1</SUB> to
behave like a countable ordinal and to make the theory of H(&omega;<SUB>2</SUB>)
not very expressive, but such behavior is a restriction, as the
development of the theory will clearly illustrate. Finally, no
definable set of real numbers negates the Continuum Hypothesis, so
the negation of the CH postulates entire cardinalities of sets of
real numbers, none of which are definable. Minimization of
unexplainable requires their nonexistence.</P>
<P>Determinacy Maximum: Every perfect information game of length &omega;<SUB>1</SUB>
with ordinal definable payoff set and with the set of allowed moves
being an ordinal is determined.<BR>(See my paper &quot;Determinacy
Maximum&quot; for analysis.)</P>
<P>Principle of Undefinability of Well-Orderings: For every infinite
cardinal &kappa; and for every cardinal &lambda; &gt; &kappa;, a
sequence of length &lambda; of distinct subsets of &kappa; (if it
exists) is not ordinal definable from any sequence of ordinals of
length less than &lambda; (update (2019-01-01) or for singular &kappa; 
of uncountable cofinality, less than &kappa; (see <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/48851/nonessential-use-of-large-cardinals/48856#48856">here</a>
for why this condition is necessary)).
<br/></P>
<P><B>Justification:</B> The principle captures our intuition that
there is no natural way to<BR>pick which elements go first in a
well-ordering of a power set, so one has to use the axiom of choice
to choose the elements. For example, given two arbitrary real
numbers, it appears that there is no way to decide which of them
should be first in a well-ordering. It is a maximization principle as
it suggests that arbitrary subsets exist rather than only those that
have enough regularity to fit in a definable well-ordering.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>More Principles</B></P>
<P>In addition, there are interesting hypotheses that appear to be
true but not yet sufficiently analyzed to be proposed axioms. To be
effective, set theory must have sufficient set existence axioms.
While ZFC suffices for many purposes, the large number of
incompletenesses shows that more axioms are needed. However, the new
existence axioms&mdash;determinacy hypotheses being the most
prominent examples&mdash;are subtle and require careful analysis to
establish their truthfulness.</P>
<P>An interesting strengthening of the principle of undefinability of
well-orderings for regular cardinals is that for every regular
infinite cardinal &kappa;, every set of subsets of &kappa; that is
ordinal definable from &kappa; ordinal parameters either has
cardinality at most &kappa; or contains a perfect subset. (This
implies the GCH.) Specifically, for a limit ordinal &kappa;, a tree T
of height &kappa; is said to be perfect if every totally ordered
subset of T is contained in a path, and every path has &kappa; points
at which the tree branches. A set of subsets of &kappa; is a perfect
subset if it is the set of paths through a perfect tree of height &kappa;.</P>
<P>On a similar line, one can ask whether for every regular cardinal
&kappa;, every Baire game of length &kappa; with the payoff set
ordinal definable from &kappa; ordinal parameters is determined. 
</P>
<P>An interesting forcing hypothesis is that collapsing all
uncountable cardinals below an inaccessible to &omega;<SUB>1</SUB>
does not change the theory of H(<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>2</SUB>).
The hypothesis should resolve in a canonical way many
incompletenesses of third order arithmetic. More generally, for every
(?) infinite regular cardinal &kappa;, collapsing all cardinals
strictly between &kappa; and a cardinal above &kappa;, yields with
respect to H(&kappa;<SUP>+</SUP>) an elementary extension. &kappa;<SUP>+</SUP>
should be so inaccesibly large that making it larger by collapsing
some cardinals above &kappa; should not be noticeable in H(&kappa;<SUP>+</SUP>).
To produce stronger results, one can ask for invariance under
collapsing of all cardinals strictly between &kappa; (such as <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>1</SUB>)
and a cardinal above &kappa; for the theory L(H(&kappa;<SUP>+</SUP>)).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The defining property of regular cardinals is that for every
regular cardinal &kappa;, every partition of &kappa; into less than &kappa;
sets contains a set of cardinality &kappa;. A natural strengthening
of this is the Generalized Suslin Hypothesis: For every infinite
regular cardinal &kappa;, a tree of height &kappa; either has a path
(of length &kappa;) or contains an anti-chain of cardinality &kappa;.<BR><B>Note:</B>
The Generalized Suslin Hypothesis is certainly an interesting
statement, but it may well be false (it contradicts &loz;). There is
an uncountable partial order that includes neither an uncountable set
of pairwise comparable elements, nor an uncountable set of pairwise
incomparable elements.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Absoluteness under Forcing</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>One way to capture the maximality of the parts of the
universe is through absolutenfss under forcing: Extending an image of
the parts with certain generic sets should not alter the theory (the
generic extension should be an elementary extension of the theory)
because the parts are already the largest possible, so it should not
be possible to make them larger. The statement that L(R) is absolute
under forcing provides true canonical theory of L(R), which maximizes
which sets are constructible above the reals.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>As the level of expressiveness becomes higher, the
ability to change the truth of statements between models increases,
so the amount of absoluteness decreases: <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&Delta;<SUP>0</SUP><SUB>1</SUB>
statements are absolute under all models</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&Sigma;</FONT><SUP>0</SUP><SUB>n</SUB>
statements are absolute for all <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT>-models,
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&Pi;</FONT><SUP>1</SUP><SUB>1</SUB>
statements are absolute for well-founded models, and <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&Sigma;<SUP>1</SUP><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>
statements are absolute for wellfounded models (containing basic set
theory) that include <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>1
</SUB>. At the level of third order arithmetic, the expressiveness is
so great that there are plenty of opportunities for forcing and hence
no absoluteness under all forcing.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Absoluteness requires that the models are sufficiently
well-behaved. Adding real numbers can dramatically upset the
structure of higher set theory: V[G] would satisfy that it is a
generic extension by a single real number. Accordingly, a reasonable
restriction is to require the forcing not to add real numbers. Under
the restriction, we do have an absoluteness theorem:<BR><B>Theorem:</B>
If H(<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>2</SUB>) is <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>&Sigma;</B><SUP>2</SUP><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>
absolute under forcing that does not add reals, then the Continuum
Hypothesis holds. Under suitable large cardinal axioms, the converse
also holds.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The restriction is too weak for <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&Sigma;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>2</SUB>
statements as one can force the Diamond Principle (&loz;) and the
Suslin Hypothesis by forcing that does not add reals. Instead, one
can require models to be well-behaved by being countably closed.</FONT>
However, forcing ordinarily works on countable transitive models, so
to work with countably closed models, an appropriate restriction is
for the partial ordering to be countably closed (for every countable
descending sequence, there is an element smaller than every member of
the sequence).</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Theorem:</B> If H(<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>2</SUB>)
is <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&Sigma;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>
absolute under countably closed forcing, then &loz; holds.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In fact, whenever countably closed forcing adds subsets
of <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;<SUB>1</SUB></FONT>, &loz; is
forced.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Conjecture </B>(based on a conjecture of Woodin)<B>:</B>
Under suitable large cardinal axioms the generic version of &loz;
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(absoluteness under Coll(<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;<SUB>1</SUB></FONT>,
<B>R</B>))</FONT> implies that H(<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>2</SUB>)
is <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>&Sigma;</B><SUP>2</SUP><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>
absolute under countably closed forcing.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Unfortunately, both the
Kurepa Hypothesis (a <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&Sigma;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
statement) and its negation can be forced by countably closed
forcing. An interesting addtional restriction is that the cardinality
of the generic set is <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>1
</SUB>.<BR><B>Question:</B> How much absoluteness is possible under
countably closed forcing for which the generic set has cardinality <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>1</SUB>
in the generic extension or under products of such forcings?</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">For example, I do not see
any way to force the Kurepa Hypothesis with such forcing.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Forcing and Definability:</B> In M[G], every set is
definable from parameters in M and G. One could argue that after
adding a generic subset of <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>1</SUB>
G, for some properties of G the witnesses are not definable from M
and G, so one has to add sets that witness the specific properties G.
However, any addition of witnesses by countably closed forcing
preserves &loz;. No well-ordering of real numbers is definable
because one has to pick continuum many parameters and there is no way
to choose which of the real numbers go before which. A generic subset
of <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>1</SUB> already
picks which the parameters go first, so there is no reason to expect
that no matter how sufficiently closed the ground model M is, none of
the witnesses for a property of G expressible in the first order
language of H(<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&omega;</FONT><SUB>2</SUB>)
are available in M[G]. For example, if the ground model for second
order arithmetic is sufficiently closed, then adding a generic real
does not change its properties as the witnesses for the properties
are definable from the real number.</P>
