<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Electing Presidents</H1>
<P>The following constitutional amendment will improve the way United
States Presidents are selected:</P>
<P>The President of the United States of America shall be elected by
popular vote.&#160; In each of the States, the qualification to vote
for the President shall be the same as the qualification to vote for a
Senator.&#160; The Congress shall by law provide qualifications for
voting for the President on the territories of the United States not
belonging to any of the several states provided that the
qualifications are the same on all of the territories and the
qualifications would be legal if the territories were a state and the
election is for the United States Senate.</P>
<P>In addition to the first choice, each voter may provide on the
ballot the second choice for the President.&#160;&#160; For each
voter, if the first choice is not for one of the two candidates
having the largest number of first choice votes but the second choice
is, then the second choice shall be counted as if it was the first
choice.&#160; Each Presidential candidate shall announce the
corresponding vice-Presidential candidate before the election.&#160;
The vice-Presidential candidate shall become the vice-president of
the United States if the corresponding presidential candidate is
elected.&#160; The presidential candidate with the most votes wins
the election.&#160; The only requirement to be a presidential or
vice-presidential candidate is United States citizenship.&#160; The
only additional requirement to become President after winning the
election is pledging of the oath or affirmation described in the
Article II of the Constitution.</P>
<P>The presidential election in each of the states shall be conducted
by the state under such appropriate regulations as the Congress may
provide.&#160; In the territories that are not states the Congress
shall by law state who will conduct the election.&#160; Presidential
election will be conducted in November once every four years.&#160;
All ties will be resolved randomly under such laws as the Congress
may establish.&#160; The election may not be contested in court after
inauguration of the declared winner. &#160;The amendment becomes
effective on the first of September following its passage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This amendment is beneficial and necessary for the following
reasons:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>The Electoral College is not a
	deliberating body.&#160; It simply &quot;rubber-stamps&quot; the
	popular vote counted in a strange way. 
	<LI>The Electoral College does not
	distinguish whether a candidate received 51% or 80% of the vote in
	the state but distinguishes between 49% and 51% in a two way race.&#160;
	The &quot;winner take all system&quot; in each of the states is
	unnecessary and causes inaccurate measurement of the will of the
	people. 
	<LI>Since the USA is a democracy,
	people in its territories should be allowed to vote for the
	President.
	<LI>Number of people per presidential elector in a small state is
	larger than in a large state.&#160; (Each state has 2 electors
	corresponding to its Senate seats.)&#160; The amendment above
	follows the principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot;.
	<LI>Currently, third party candidates
	hurt the major candidate with views similar to the third party
	candidate by drawing away votes. &#160;The ability to make a second
	choice will eliminate the problem.&#160; (For example, Ralph Nader
	took more votes away from Al Gore than from George Bush.&#160;
	Ideally, Nader's candidacy should have helped Gore's candidacy
	because both were advocating similar policies.) 
	<LI>Special qualifications (such as age) for the President are
	undesirable since they prevent potential best Presidents from being
	elected.
